<p>Would it be possible to add back the scan % messages back to the verbose modes?</p>
</section>
<p> It has not been removed. It only happens durring the background scan.</p>

<p>The method I used in the past for loading sales data for the period between my last login and my current login was to set verbosity to 4 so I could see the % of each guild scan. I would then run through each guild history sales (by pressing E) until MM showed 100% for that guild (I am never offline for more than 3 days so I always had full data). Once it hit 100% for a guild I would do the next guild. The entire process took less than a minute (despite being in several major trade guilds) and it always gave me full data each day.</p>
</section>
<p>The current message is not any indication that there is a certain ammount of time being scaned.</p>

<p>There has never been any way to scan a range of data. You get the initial 100 most recent sales, and then you can request more older sales. To do so press E on the guild history tab.</p>

<p>I can scan days of history once a week.</p>

<p>There is no point in doing this as you have already seen the data unless you didn't log in enough to keep your data up to date.</p>

<p>The server gives you older data when you request it by pressing E on the guild history tab. New sales are received when the server provides them.</p>

<p>It worked fine this morning, but when I log in now, it tells me for 4 of my 5 guilds "Guild XY has no sales" (verbose 4) even though they are all trading guilds. Is there way to fix this? There should be several hundred new sales to scan.</p>

<p>I have no idea how else am I supposed to get any sales when MM got to about five hours worth of history in several hours of the game sitting idle.</p>
</section>
<p>MM can not request data like a streaming video server. If you do not have several hundred sales to scan in your guild history then you will not see the updates you expect.</p>
