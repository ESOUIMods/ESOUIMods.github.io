== Preface

While attempting to use IntelliJ for running Lua files it was recommended by the kind ESOUI community that I install LuaRocks. They did mention it was a packadge manager but my intention was to have a stand alone Interpreter for Lua to be used with the Lua plugin I installed for IntelliJ. Installing it not having written the .bat file was an experience.

They do offer detailed [[https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Installation-instructions-for-Windows | install instructions for Windows]] however, I noticed it was more for intermediate to advanced users. It covers where to install, configuring the destinations, configuring the Lua interpreter, and compiler configuration. Under the heading `Making a system-wide repository` which was misleading to me because I thought I would be making a Git repository that was system wide.

Further down the page there is information for making a self-contained installation, Picking the Lua interpreter and link to [[https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Using-LuaRocks | using LuaRocks]]

However, nothing to get the software installed so that you can follow along step by step and read each section to configure the software for use. Nor was there a section on how to use Lua if you wanted to read [[https://www.lua.org/docs.html | Lua documentation]] to understand the basics of the Lua language.

== Intent

I will explain how to install LuaRocks below. Setting up IntelliJ to use LuaRock will be explained once I figure out how to do that.

== Download the legacy Windows package

You are going to want the __legacy Windows package, includes Lua 5.1__ file from the link below.

[[http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/ | luarocks]]

{{image:download_luarocks.jpg | Download}}

This will have all you need including Lua exe files.

== Installing the legacy Windows package

To install the legacy windows packadge you need unzip the download to a folder and navagate to that first in order to run the install.bat file. I exctracted my file in the downloads folder.

{{image:download_loc_luarocks.jpg | location}}

Once there type <code>install /P C:\Lua51 /L</code> which will install luarocks and Lua to the <code>C:\Lua51</code>

{{image:install_cmd_luarocks.jpg | location}}

If you navagte to <code>C:\Lua51</code> from the windwos explorer you should now have Lua installed.

After the install completes it will explain in detail what happend as shown in the spoiler below.

At the end of the installation it will explain that you may need want to add things to the path. If you closed that, I list it below as a reference.

<pre>
You may want to add the following elements to your paths;
Lua interpreter;
  PATH     :   C:\Lua51
  PATHEXT  :   .LUA
LuaRocks;
  PATH     :   C:\Lua51
  LUA_PATH :   C:\Lua51\lua\?.lua;C:\Lua51\lua\?\init.lua
Local user rocktree (Note: %APPDATA% is user dependent);
  PATH     :   %APPDATA%\LuaRocks\bin
  LUA_PATH :   %APPDATA%\LuaRocks\share\lua\5.1\?.lua;%APPDATA%\LuaRocks\share\l
ua\5.1\?\init.lua
  LUA_CPATH:   %APPDATA%\LuaRocks\lib\lua\5.1\?.dll
System rocktree
  PATH     :   C:\Lua51\systree\bin
  LUA_PATH :   C:\Lua51\systree\share\lua\5.1\?.lua;C:\Lua51\systree\share\lua\5
.1\?\init.lua
  LUA_CPATH:   C:\Lua51\systree\lib\lua\5.1\?.dll

Note that the %APPDATA% element in the paths above is user specific and it MUST
be replaced by its actual value.
For the current user that value is: C:\Users\Redacted\AppData\Roaming.
</pre>

== Now what

Simple. It is installed. Doesn't mean I can use it with IntelliJ and the Emmy Lua plugin I have because now I have to research that. However, it is installed.
