Master Merchant is pretty complex. While I try to keep it somewhat simple, you do need to read carefully as this is not just a bit of light reading.

= Features

Master Merchant offers additional features for the Traders of trading guilds. However, the Bonanza module can be used by anyone looking for deals in Tamriel.

## For Players not in a Trading Guild:
Use Bonanza to search for deals. It creates a virtual Auction House of sorts. Searches remain in the Bonanza window for 24 hours. An average price is generated depending on how many of each item you find. However, you will want to filter for items in the Bonanza window to seek out the cheapest price for items found.

= Major Changes with Update 41!

With Update 41 all of your previously stored LibHistoire sales data will be deleted. You can read more about the changes in [[ https://www.esoui.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10724 | this thread]].

{{note: Your Master Merchant sales data <font class="yellow">**will not be deleted or reset**</font> once U41 is released.}}

## Preface: Understanding the Zenimax Database Changes

Before delving into the details, it's crucial to clarify that the transition from id64 to id53 for sales identifiers is not the main reason behind their reset. Even if the identifier type remained unchanged, the same issue would persist. Zenimax made this change to enhance the efficiency of handling sales identifiers and introduced a new database structure for storing guild history data on the server.

I will focus on why this matters to you as a Master Merchant user. If you notice duplicate sales in the interface, rest assured that it's not an error caused by the id64 to id53 transition. This unavoidable situation stems from the changes in how Zenimax stores sales data. I'll help you understand the impact and your options.

## Important Reminder!

Because the changes to the Zenimax server's database are significant, it's recommended to have a backup made prior to Update 41 to restore if changes are made to Master Merchant functionality after launch. Likewise, if Zenimax makes any changes that would directly impact how the data is obtained from the local binary file stored on each user's hard drive.

{{note: For more information review how to [[#|Backup LibGuildStore Data]]. }}

## Introduction

In the upcoming Elder Scrolls Online Update 41, Zenimax is making changes to the Guild History data. The server database for sales data has been updated, and due to that, the unique sales identifiers will not continue from where they left off prior to the update. One significant consequence for users is the inability to check for duplicate sales between the old and new database entries.

{{image:dupe_sales_image.jpg | dupe_sales_image}}

Using the image as an example, without the timestamp (1709606076) and without the unique identifier, the sales would be duplicates because they are all from the same seller, buyer, for the same item, and the same amount.

## Transition from id64 to id53

In Update 41, Zenimax is implementing significant changes to the Guild History data, introducing a new guild history format and resetting the server's database. Consequently, unique sales identifiers are starting over, and the system will now use the id53 format. This shift is not solely about the transition from id64 to id53; it's part of a broader move toward a more efficient guild history database structure.

<font class="yellow">Paraphrasing the UI developer Dan Batson:</font>

Luainteger53 is superior because it allows for straightforward mathematical computations and comparisons without the need for complex functions. It can handle values as high as 2^53 (9,007,199,254,740,992) without precision issues. Id64 will still be used when needed such as character IDs. Luainteger53 was introduced a few updates ago and continuing to utilize id64 would be like holding onto an outdated and problematic system just for tradition's sake, which isn't a philosophy I support.

## Adapting Master Merchant to the Changes

With these changes, and because the id53 identifiers have started over, Master Merchant will be separating data using the id64 and id53 identifiers. Master Merchant will be able to check duplicates only when the same type of data is compared, meaning id64 and id64 or id53 and id53 because the Zenimax server database is different.

All item averages used for evaluating item pricing and weekly sales totals for Guild Masters will only be accurate when using data from the new Zenimax cache and the id53 identifiers.

While there will be a toggle to utilize the old sales data, without the ability to properly check for duplicate sales, data using id53 mixed with the older id64 data will mean those totals will not be accurate.

## Impact on Master Merchant Users

For the majority, the changes will have minimal impact because the binary cache should already contain data. Users that retain 30 to 90 days of data will not have a significant loss of data, and Guild Masters will be able to accurately track recent weeks for evaluating user contribution in sales.

However, users archiving extensive sales data, trying to be the library of congress of data, will have inaccurate averages when the id53 and id64 data overlap.

Additionally, I would like to remind users that maintaining an excessive amount of sales data in the Zenimax binary cache will negatively impact load times during login, even if Master Merchant is disabled.

= Setup Master Merchant 3.0

If you are installing Master Merchant for the first time please follow these steps. If you do not wait to see that the Refresh is complete in the chat window and if you do not perform a [[#|Ten Day Scan]] then you won't have the initial Ten Days of sales data from the server to start using to price items.

* Install Master Merchant 3.0
* Log In
* Wait for Refresh to finish
* Perform a [[#|Ten Day Scan]]
* Read how to [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]]

== What is required

{{note: You can still use ATT and MM at the same time if you chose. There is a toggle to disable the notification under <font class="purple">Debug Options</font> under the [[#MM Debug Options | MasterMerchat settings]].}}

* Master Merchant 3.7.x
* LibExecutionQueue
* LibGuildStore
* LibGuildStore Data File GS00Data, LibGuildStore Data File GS01Data, etc.
* LibAddonMenu
* LibMediaProvider
* LibGuildRoster
* LibHistoire
* LibAsync
* LibDebugLogger
* LibAlchemy
* LibPrice

== What to disable when MM is not needed

If you are with a trial group or doing daily writs you may not want MM running in the background to reduce loading times. If you do make sure to disable all of the following.

* Master Merchant 3.7.x
* LibExecutionQueue
* LibGuildStore
* LibGuildStore Data File GS00Data, LibGuildStore Data File GS01Data, etc.

[[sb:Spoiler1 | When Deactivating ]]
{{image:mm_installed_activated.jpg | mm_installed_activated}}
{{image:all_libguildstore_modules.jpg | all_libguildstore_modules}}
[[se:]]

== Importing older Master Merchant Data

{{note: <font class="yellow">Caution</font>, the more data you import the longer MM will need to load.}}

Download [[https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3334-ImportersforMasterMerchant3.0.html | Importers for Master Merchant 3.0]] which includes all the Master Merchant Data File modules MM00Data, Master Merchant Data File MM01Data, etc. and ShoppingList.

You can import older Master Merchant Data if you have backups for those who like being the library of congress of data. Just know that it will increase load times and the game will take longer to log out as well while saving the data.

{{note: If you are experiencing issues after trying the following steps you can review the section [[#|Alternate Upgrade Method]].}}

### MMxxData modules needed for importing

The MMxxData (MM00Data, MM01Data, etc.) modules are used for importing data only. After your import your data, these old modules should be deactivated.

{{nav:disablemmmodules}}
[[sb:Spoiler2 | Disable MM Modules]]
{{image:disable_mm.jpg | disable_mm}}
[[se:]]

{{note: Because of how saved variables work you have to enable the old MMxxData modules to load the data into memory.}}

== What to expect after you log in for the first time

{{image:startup_refresh.jpg | startup_refresh}}

once you log in the LibHistorie Refresh will start. You will know when the refresh has finished when you see, <font class="yellow">LibGuildStore Refresh Finished</font> appear in the chat window. You will need to get your first ten days of data to complete the initial setup. Review the section [[#|Ten Day Scan]].

Once the initial refresh is finished you can import sales from MM. This is to accommodate people who may have more history in their MM data files then they do in LibHistorie. You can also import from ATT for the same reason. If you have been using ATT and have never used MM then you could have 30 days of data in your ATT data files. After you import your ATT data and do a Ten Day with LibHistorie you will have the most data possible. You can also import purchases from ATT and the old standalone ShoppingList for MM. There will be notifications to disable the old MMxxData modules, the old ShoppingList standalone module, and ATT. There is an option to disable the ATT notification if you prefer to use both MM and ATT at the same time.

= Troubleshooting

## Duplicate Indexes Detected

{{image:duplicate_indexes_detected.jpg | duplicate_indexes_detected}}

If this notification appears then you either need to cancel and restore a backup or allow Master Merchant to reset all its internal data files and refresh sales data from LibHistorie.

{{note: Your LibHistorie cache will not be reset by accepting to reset Master Merchant data files.}}

## Game freezes after clicking Rescan button

{{image:rescan_button.jpg | rescan_button}}

- Close the game entirely, do not log in if you are at the password screen, or at least be at the Character Selection Screen.
- Go to SavedVariables usually <code>.\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\SavedVariables</code>
- Rename <font class="yellow">LibHistoire.lua</font> to <font class="green">LibHistoire_bak.lua</font>. <font class="orange">DO NOT delete it!</font>
- Log in and perform a [[#|Ten Day Scan]]
- Then [[#|Refresh LibHistoire]]

## LibGuildStore.lua:309: attempt to index a nil value

<pre>
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/Libs/LibGuildStore/LibGuildStore.lua:309: attempt to index a nil value
</pre>

If you have the above error then that means you deactivated Master Merchant but not the rest of the required modules. You need to deactivate all of the GSxxData modules and LibGuildStore. This is mentioned in [[#| What to disable when MM is not needed]]

{{note: If you intend to use Master Merchant and you have the above error then you need to update or activate the required modules for Master Merchant.}}

## Lua errors

There are times when the game for some reason will corrupt GS16Data.lua or GS17Data.lua and when that happens ESO will reset the file. Once that happens nothing about Master Merchant will work with the existing data. You won't be able to open the Master Merchant UI to view sales data or if you hover over the dots on the Graph you will have errors similar to what is shown below.

<pre>
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/MasterMerchant_UI.lua:458: operator .. is not supported for string .. nil
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/MasterMerchant_UI.lua:573: operator .. is not supported for string .. nil
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/MasterMerchant_UI.lua:970: operator .. is not supported for string .. nil
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/Libs/LibGuildStore/Data.lua:337: attempt to index a nil value
</pre>

While in game go to the LibGuildStore settings menu and look for the heading [[#Reset Data | Reset LibGuildStore ]].

After you click the <font class="ltblue">Reset LibGuildStore Data</font> button the UI will reload and Master Merchant will get information from the LibHistoire cache. After the UI reloads about every minute you will see that Master Merchant is still refreshing data. There will be an approximated time remaining that will go up and down because it's not perfect.

{{note: Do not log out, do writs, open a guild trader, update LibHistorie data, or do anything else until the refresh is complete. Do nothing except maybe move enough or type in guild chat so you don't go AFK.}}

## OneDrive

OneDrive is great for many reasons however, for ESO it can create a situation where the GS16Data.lua and GS17Data.lua files are not synced properly. I would think this would affect any of the GSxxData.lua saved variable files because of their size. They may not syncronize quickly with some internet users because of upload and download speeds being limited. To resolve this you need to change settings so that OneDrive will no longer try to backup your Documents folder where all your Addons and SavedVariables file are located.

{{note: I will admit I do not have Windows 10 or Windows 11 so this is peiced together from helping someone.}}

{{image:onedrive_cloud_icon.jpg | onedrive_cloud_icon}}

First open the OneDrive settings by clicking the Cloud icon for OneDrive.

{{image:manage_backup_button.jpg | manage_backup_button}}

Click the Manage Backup button.

{{image:onedrive_folders_to_backup.jpg | onedrive_folders_to_backup}}

As shown in the above screen shot all three folders are being monitored by OneDrive. You want to disable the backup for the Documents folder.

{{image:onedrive_documents_folders_disabled.jpg | onedrive_documents_folders_disabled}}

Now OneDrive will no longer try to backup the Documents folder.

{{image:onedrive_folders_where_to_backup.jpg | onedrive_folders_where_to_backup}}

If prompted, chose <font class="yellow">This Computer Only</font> so that OneDrive will not attempt to backup your Documents folder.

{{note: You do not have to pay for OneDrive or update to get more space. If you have any issues pausing or stoping OneDrive so that you can change the settings just wait longer until it pauses or stops. It may take a while but it will happen.}}

= Shopping List

{{image:shopping_list_view.jpg | shopping_list_view}}

Adds a new icon allowing you to view purchases you make from guild stores.

{{inline:24px | shopping_list.jpg | shopping_list}} The <font class="tan">Shopping List</font> icon allows you to select the installed extension and view purchases you have made from guild stores.

{{note: The by old Shopping List extension by MildFlavour is not longer used and can be disabled after you import your purchases.}}

= Bonanza!

{{image:Bonanza.png | Bonanza}}

Shop all of Tamriel with [[https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2143-BeamMeUp-TeleporterFastTravel.html | Beam Me Up]] and Bonanza. Master Merchant is not just for high end traders anymore. If you are shopping for the best deal you can find it in the Bonanza window.

{{image:bonanza_window.jpg | bonanza_window}}

With MM 3.7.x the Bonanza {{inline:24px | bonanza_icon.jpg | bonanza_icon}} icon allows you to view items you have seen at traders as you shop for items to purchase.

## Bonanza Name Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter.jpg | bonanza_window_filter}}

## Bonanza Type Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter_type.jpg | bonanza_window_filter_type}}

## Bonanza - Using BeamMeUp

{{image:bonanza_window_beammeup.jpg | bonanza_window_beammeup}}

{{note: If you have BeamMeUp installed you can right click the Location column to travel to the zone the trader is located in with the usual BeamMeUp restrictions. If there are no players in the zone to jump to BeamMeUp will notify you and you may travel to a wayshrine that is not close to the trader.}}

= Outliers

{{image:less_then_five_outliers.jpg | less_then_five_outliers}}

With only 5 sales the obvious outlier is not ignored.

{{note: There must be at least 6 sales before Master Merchant can ignore outliers.}}

{{image:outlier_ignored.jpg | outlier_ignored}}

With 8 sales of the same item you can see that the obvious outlier is being ignored.

{{note: When ignoring outliers with 6 or more sales that does not mean the highest and lowest sale will be ignored. The lowest and highest price may be well within range and reasonable prices. The above example is a good example to show the remaining 7 are well within tolerance of one another.}}

== Controlling skewed prices

{{note: People will intentionally try to sell items much higher then they are worth. Use the resources available rather then squint at the scatter plot.}}

{{image:bonanza_skewed_prices.jpg | bonanza_skewed_prices}}

While viewing a graph as shown above find out who is skewing the price and add them to the [[#|Guild & Account filter]].

{{image:resolved_skewed_price.jpg | resolved_skewed_price}}

Once the seller is added to the [[#|Guild & Account filter]] you can see that the graph is much more useful.

{{note: The absence of the Bonanza price is not what corrected the graph. The Bonanza average changed because the seller of the item listed for 3000g is being ignored. Other listings of the same item for 200g would not have the same drastic affect as the listing for 3000g.}}

{{image:bonanza_guild_account_filter.jpg | bonanza_guild_account_filter}}

For convenience you can add sellers to the Guild & Account filter from the Bonanza menu.

= MM Price vs TTC vs Bonanza

{{note: There are several examples because I feel Bonanza is new and it may be hard to understand the various ways to use it. I highly suggest reading all of the following sections.}}

{{inline:256px | example_1_hlaalu.jpg | example_1_hlaalu}}{{inline:256px | example_2_cuirass.jpg | example_2_cuirass}}{{inline:256px | example_3_bow.jpg | example_3_bow}}{{inline:256px | example_4_plating.jpg | example_4_plating}}

* The MM price is in <font class="yellow">yellow text</font>, and it is the price the item sold for in one of the guilds you are in. It is not a price from other outside sources like other guilds on the server and it is not from TTC.
* The TTC Price is from their own data collected by their EXE and transmitted to their server. They trim outliers using their own method and then make an average of the remaining data.
* The Bonanza Price is in <font class="blue">blue text</font> and it is an average from a 24 hour snapshot of all the listings you have seen of that specific item from the traders you have visited.

Looking at the first example of the Hlaalu Bookcase you see it sold 1 time out of all the guilds I am in. So there is no way to get a reasonable price for it. Someone listed it 56 days ago for 100K and it sold. That is one of the drawbacks of the MM price. If you do not have many sales from the guilds you are in then the MM price won't be very helpful. Also from the first example you see that the TTC price is about 19K and the Bonanza price is 17K. There are 9 listings from TTC and 1 from another trader. Once you have more data the Bonanza price may change but you can more easily see that 17K to 19K would probably be a more reasonable price then 100K.

From the second and third examples you will note that the TTC price is useless for these items.  The TTC price can sometimes be very helpful. The bonanza price is also higher then the MM price. This is where the Bonanza window will be needed because you will need to search for the exact item and look at the prices you have found. This is discussed in the section [[#Evaluating the Bonanza price | Evaluating the Bonanza price]]

The Bonanza price while similar to TTC is the average of what you have found at the traders you have visited in the last 24 hours. Bonanza itself is intended to be a shopping tool but since the data is there it is displayed on the graph for you to use as another way to evaluate what the item is currently selling for. If you only have 1 to 3 sales you can not compute an average from that I'd suggest 5 or more depending on how popular it is on traders at the time.

For the last example you will note that the Bonanza price for Chromium Plating is only about 22K above the MM price. With more data it may even fall exactly in line with the MM price. The TTC suggested price is 239Kwhich is 2K different then the Bonanza average. For items that normally do not have a lot of skew to the pricing data this will be common. For items that have more outliers skewing the pricing data you will need to evaluate the TTC and Bonanza prices to get a better idea of what may be a good price to sell the item for.

## Evaluating the Bonanza price

{{inline:256px | bonanza_tooltip_style_page.jpg | bonanza_tooltip_style_page}}{{inline:512px | low_end_prices.jpg | low_end_prices}}{{inline:512px | high_end_prices.jpg | high_end_prices}}

{{note: If those are too small, right click the image and show it in a new tab to see the full size.}}

Looking at the tooltip TTC shows 74K to 93K, the Bonanza average is 158K, and the MM price is 70K. Then the highest and lowest listing in TTC is 446 to 5M. With TTC you can not view the current prices being used for their suggestion. You can view the Bonanza prices to evaluate what other people are selling the item for. For this example you would open the Bonanza window and search for <font class="tan">style zero cuirass</font>.

As you see in the middle screenshot the prices range from 50K to 80K. In the last screen shot the highest prices are 1M to 3.9M.  So now you have three prices all in about the same range. 1) 50K to 80K 2) 70K 3) 74 to 93K and all without opening external websites, google docs pages, or spreadsheets. It didn't require two monitors and it took only a few moments.

It is easy to see that 70K is probably the best average price to sell the style page for. If you want it to see faster because you want it out of your inventory, 50K won't bee too low that someone might flip it and even if they do you still made close to the going rate of 70K.

{{note: Just because the Bonanza price is not 70K and is showing 158K doesn't mean it is inaccurate. In this example it is being affected by all the prices above 1M. Although you can not see the data you will be able to view your own. For the data used in the screen shots 99 of the prices were above 100K which will affect the average significantly. This is why I recommend you evaluate the price in the manner described.}}

## Price Sold vs. Price Listed

The above items are meant to show items that have an unusual range for the TTC price or Bonanza price because it is the listed price. For items like style pages if there are 124 listings and 99 of them are 100K and above you may wonder if you could make more from selling the item. Maybe and maybe not. This is the difference between what the item sold for which is the MM price and what the item is listed for which it the Bonanza or TTC price. Think of how an author might write a book. They write the book so it is appealing to their audience. So imagine who will be buying your items. Do they have 6M to spend on something and plenty of gold left over? Does your buyer have 6M at all? Have they ever had 6M at one time? Are they willing to spend 6M for the item? It is simple common sense that if someone has 124 items to choose from they will buy the cheapest one. Just because something sold for 5M or 6M 60 days ago when the item was scarce and someone had that much to spend on the item doesn't mean people will pay that price when the item is less scarce.

The above examples don't represent things like crafting materials where the pricing is more consistent and the MM price is more reliable. With the example of crafting materials that is simple supply and demand. If you want to read an article on it be my guest and you can enjoy such wonderful words as equilibrium and elasticity, knock yourself out. There are a lot of crafting materials on guild stores so there is a large supply and there is a large demand for them. Because there is a consistent need for them people purchase the cheapest listed items and the price remains rather consistent. 

This is not the case for everything. Take your time and use the different prices and tools to evaluate what you are selling, what others are selling it for, and what others are buying it for.

## Comparisons between Bonanza, TTC, and MM

{{image:style_page_thurvokun.png | style_page_thurvokun}}

To start with you will have people that list an item for something stupid and it just contaminates the TTC database. They should be prevented from uploading TTC prices from the TTC developers. When you have items with no data or items that people feel should sell for millions of gold then those are harder to evaluate.

That isn't what I will cover in this section because that kind of data is not usable.

Look at these examples of the Bonanza price

{{image:dreugh_wax_bonanza.png | dreugh_wax_bonanza}}

Bonanza is within 1K approximately from TTC and the MM average.

{{image:blassed_thistle_bonanza.png | blassed_thistle_bonanza}}

Bonanza is 1g away from the TTC average.

Most sales noobs feel you have to have millions of sales in your database, years and years of stuff, and preserve data like you are the library of congress or something. If you look at both of those screen shots TTC has data points in the thousands. 15,000 for the Dreugh Wax, and 2,800 for the Blessed Thistle. Yet I have the same price for the Blessed Thistle with only a few hundred data points.

I could write Lua code that anyone could copy and paste into an online Lua compiler that could show you how I can add a variety of numbers and come out with a certain average, say 100. Then I could add together another set of data that has different and more numbers, and still come within approximately 5g of the average I am looking for. A range of 95g - 105g more or less.

The example would be bias of course because I am demonstrating that if you when you add 100, 99, 90, 95 and so on.. together that you get a specific average. If you load more of the same numbers you will get the same average. I don't care how many times you add 100 + 100 + 100, it will be the same outcome.

In statistics this is called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics) | Mode]]. So the value that appears most often. Commonly sold materials such as Chromium Grains, Dreugh Wax, Clam Gall, Blessed Thistle and such that the data is fairly consistent. When data is more consistent you don't need thousands of data points to get the proper average.

Don't make it work. If you visit 3 or 4 cities and search for key items at all traders then you should have enough data to work with. TTC and Bonanza should be close however, it depends on the pricing people use. Some people post the TTC Suggested price and some post the Average price. It depends on the demand of the item and the price.

The other benefit of Bonanza is that you can view the prices. Which is what I show in my documentation under [[#|Evaluating the Bonanza price]]. If you feel the price is not in line with TTC or listings from other traders then look. If other traders list a style page for 50K and that is the most common value then that is the going rate. You can then price your items to be competitive with other guilds.

So it may be a bit of information overload but without the need for two monitors, viewing the TTC website, viewing google docs, viewing spreadsheets, exporting prices from MM to paste on websites, just use the Master Merchant interface. It is simple and easy to switch views and search for things to compare information without leaving the game to look at outside sources for information.

= Three states of LibHistoire cache

## Unlinked

{{image:red_text_unlinked.jpg | red_text_unlinked}}

In the Unlinked state you can either wait for the server to grant the requests for offline data that LibHistoire requests, or you can manually request guild history for the time you were offline.

## Linking in progress

{{image:yellow_text_linking.jpg | yellow_text_linking}}

Once LibHistoire has what it feels it needs, then it will begin processing the guild history events and attempt to link to the last known event.

## Linking in progress, with 0 events left

{{image:process_stuck.jpg | process_stuck}}

If you ever see it processing 0 events for a while you will just need to wait for the events to link. If there are external factors involved then nothing will process until that is no longer affecting LibHistoire.

## Linked

{{image:green_text_linked.jpg | green_text_linked}}

Once LibHistoire has linked to its stored events you should see green text. This means that LibHistoire has finished processing the guild history.

{{note: You can still request additional history and ask LibHistoire to check the guild history for any missing sales events using the rescan button.}}

= Ten Day Scan

If you are upgrading from MM 2.5.x or installing MM 3.x for the first time, you will need to do a Ten Day Scan of all the guilds you are in. This ensures that LibHistoire has stored sales data for you to start working with.

{{note: Initially I had suggested requesting all the data at once. This seems to cause an issue for some users. Read this section carefully.}}

## Select A Guild

When you first log in there won’t be much as far as guild history loaded in memory.

{{image:show_more.jpg | show_more}}

In order to manually request sales data you have to choose a guild and select All, not purchases. Then press E about every 3 seconds so you are not kicked from the game by the server.

## Request one day at a time

{{image:one_day_of_data.jpg | one_day_of_data}}

Look at the above image and use the right scroll bar to see when you have requested one day of data. Busier guilds with more data will have more sales per day. To keep from processing too much at once request one day at a time and click the Rescan button. 

## Rescan Button

{{image:ten_day_scan_rescan.jpg | ten_day_scan_rescan}}

If you are familiar with MM 2.5.x the Rescan button is the equivalent of the old <code>/mm missing</code>. When you click Rescan LibHistoire will scan all the data loaded into memory so far and skip any duplicate events already saved in its data cache.

## When E is no longer showing

{{image:10_days_sales.jpg | show_more}}

Once you have scanned 10 days of sales then the option to press E will not be shown. The server will only allow you to request 10 days of data. Once you have done so click the [[#|Rescan Button]] to make sure LibHistoire processes all the events.

## LibHistoire GUI

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

As you perform a ten day scan the LibHistoire GUI will update. It might even finish processing a certain amount of events. Do not click the small chain link showing in this screen shot. That will link to the current events loaded which for your first initial use of LibHistoire you do not want that to happen. You should only click the [[#|Rescan Button]] if you see it to ensure all events are scanned.

{{note:Scanning 10 days of history every few days or every week is pointless and a drain on the server.}}

= Update Your Guild History Each Day

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

Regardless of how long you have been offline you need to update your guild history. To obtain older sales data for any time you have been offline you can wait for the server to send the data to LibHistoire. How quickly the server provides the data depends on many things. Because of that I do not wait. I manually scan the guild history from the guild history tab by [[#Select A Guild | pressing E for Show More]].

After I have enough guild history to cover the time I have been offline then I use the rescan button which asks LibHistoire to double check the sales loaded in memory are in the cache. Once LibHistoire has verified the sales data the text will turn green indicating that the [[#Linked | sales events are linked]].

= Unlinked Events Notification

With LibHistoire 1.2.0 there is a new notification when you log off.

{{image:log_off_notification.jpg | log_off_notification}}

You could have any amount of time that has not been linked with your Guild History Events. If you chose to log off that is fine but pay close attention to the notification. Any gap in information will still be there when you log back in and you will have to start over. Refer to [[#|Resolving Unlinked Events]] and [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] for more information.

{{note:If you open the Guild History have more then 10 days of missing events you will need to complete a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].}}

= Resolving Unlinked Events

{{image:unlinked_sales.jpg | unlinked_sales}}

The above screen shot indicates that there is 28 days and 19 hours worth of missing time from unlinked events. When this happens you can only fix it by doing a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].

To start request one day of data as shown in the screen shot [[#Request one day at a time | to request one day at a time]]. After you see one day of data then click the small chain link above sales as shown below.

{{image:chain_link.jpg | chain_link}}

After you click the chain link then you will be given a confirmation screen and you will want to click Confirm or press E to confirm the action.

{{image-caption:confirm_forcing.jpg | confirm_forcing | Since the server only stores 10 days of data, you will not be able to retrieve sales more then 10 days old.}}

Once the chain link is clicked LibHistoire will begin processing sales for the time you have loaded into memory. If you have done as suggested, it will process about 1 days worth of sales.

Then repeat the process mentioned in the [[#|Ten Day Scan]] by requesting a day or two of data and then click the small [[#|Rescan Button]]. Once the process is complete then remember to [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] so this doesn't happen again.

{{note: This can happen in any guild however, this will occur in guilds with a high volume of sales per day more easily then in a guild with smaller amounts of sales.}}

== Guild Sales and Personal Sales

{{inline:175px | show_your_info.jpg | show_your_info}}{{inline:175px | show_all_info.jpg | show_all_info}}

First select what information you would like to see. <font class="tan">Show Personal Sales</font> will display info ONLY about You. <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font> will display data from all members of all of your guilds.

{{note: When the button says <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font>, that means you are currently viewing <font class="tan">YOUR</font> information and vice-versa. You can toggle back and forth between <font class="tan">Personal Sales</font> and <font class="tan">Guild Sales</font> while viewing any report.}}

== Item Report

{{image:item_report.jpg | item_report}}

If you have ever opened the Master Merchant window you have probably seen the list of your personal sales. This is an Item Report and if you click the [[#|People Icon]] you will change between the Buyer and the Seller.

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Buyer</font>: The purchaser of the item.
* <font class="tan">Guild</font>: The guild associated with the sale of the item.
* <font class="tan">Item Sold</font>: To the left of the Item Sold is the items icon. The number indicates how many of that item was sold.
* <font class="tan">Sale Time</font>: The approximate time the item was sold. The game stores all sales using epoch time so the UI just approximates the sale after the first hour.
* <font class="tan">Price</font>: The price the item sold for. You can view the individual price by clicking the Show Unit Price button.

{{inline:132px | show_unit_price.jpg | show_unit_price}} Toggle between the Unit Price and Total Sale.

== Seller's Report

### Top Buyers and Sellers

{{image:sellers_report_people.jpg | sellers_report_people}}

### Top Items

{{image:sellers_report_items.jpg | sellers_report_items}}

### Personal Sales - Seller's Report

{{image:sellers_report_personal.jpg | sellers_report_personal}}

{{note: You can also view a Seller's Report for your personal sales only the items will be <font class="tan">YOUR</font> top selling items.}}
{{note: Clicking the People Icon will cycle through Seller, Buyer, and Item Sold.}}

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Rank</font>: The rank of the member or item for the guild listed. For example, if you are viewing a <font class="tan">seller's</font> report and your rank is <font class="tan">7</font>, it means you are the <font class="tan">7th</font> biggest <font class="tan">seller</font> in the guild for the time selected. If you are viewing an <font class="tan">item</font> report for and <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">1st</font> item in the list, then <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">biggest seller</font> for the guild showing.
* <font class="tan">Sales/Purchases</font>: Total Sales or Purchases for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Tax</font>: Total Tax generated for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Count</font>: The number on the left is the number of <font class="tan">transactions</font>, while the number on the right is the number of <font class="tan">items</font>. For example @TradingDude had <font class="yellow">10 Dreugh Wax</font> <font class="tan">transactions</font> and sold <font class="yellow">100 Dreugh wax</font> <font class="tan">total</font>.
* <font class="tan">Percent</font>: This shows what percent of total guild sales or purchases each member is responsible for.

== Guild Sales Date Filter Ranges

{{image:filter_time_frames.jpg | time_frames}}

* <font class="tan">Default</font>: Default uses the amount of days for Default set in [[#|Calculation Display Options]]. However, if you open the Master Merchant window while holding a Focus key such as SHIFT, CTRL or both, then opening the window will use the amount of days you set for that Focus.
* <font class="tan">30 Days</font>: 30 Days.
* <font class="tan">30-60 Days</font>: 30 to 60 Days.
* <font class="tan">60-90 Days</font>: 60 to 90 Days.
* <font class="tan">Custom</font>: Custom uses the amount of days set in [[#MasterMerchantWindowOptions | Master Merchant Window Options]]

== Date Ranges

{{image:time_frames.jpg | time_frames}}

There are several date ranges you can choose from. <font class="tan">This Week</font>, <font class="tan">Last Week</font> and <font class="tan">Prior Week</font> start from the ZOS trader flip for the current [[#|Sales Week]]. However, the last option is customizable under the Master Merchant settings under [[#|Calculation Display Options]].

{{note: Days are calculated from midnight and weeks are calculated from each kiosk flip on Tuesday. For example the option <font class="tan">7 Days</font> would be the last 7 days of sales while <font class="tan">Last Week</font> will be from the previous kiosk flip to the most recent kiosk flip. Both of which will be a Tuesday.}}

This is the same value as shown in the TTC Tooltip. See the <font class="tan">Modified Suggested Price</font> spoiler below for an example.

{{note: There is no function to check if you set an incorrect value or not. Meaning if <font class="white">Okay Deal Range</font> is <font class="tan">25</font> percent and the <font class="ltgreen">Reasonable Deal Range</font> is <font class="tan">20</font> percent, nothing will tell you that's not going to work.

{{image:lgs_sales_management.jpg | lgs_sales_management}}

* <font class="tan">Use Sales History Size Only</font>: This will ignore the minimum and maximum count for sales. If there are 4698 sales of an item with the day range selected for retaining data, then the sales will not be trimmed.
* <font class="tan">Minimal Indexing</font>: Does not add search words for items. It only adds the player search word for displaying personal sales. Searching in the Master merchant window is still possible but will take extra time.
* <font class="tan">Sales History Size</font>: The days range to retain data.
* <font class="tan">Min Item Count</font>: The minimum count of sales for a specific item before the days range is considered. If you select 90 days to retain data, but you have seen only 1 sale and the only recorded sale is 120 days old it will not be trimmed.
* <font class="tan">Max Item Count</font>: The maximum count of sales for a specific item before the days range is considered. If you select 90 days to retain data, and you choose 1000, then the oldest sale once the threshold is reached will be trimmed. Meaning if you have 1001 sales for an item, 1 will be trimmed and 1000 will remain.
* <font class="tan">Min Sales Interval</font>: When this value is greater then 0 the Min item count and the sales interval (in Days) will be considered first before truncating. If the interval is set to 10 days and the sale is less then 10 days old the sale will be retained the same as a sale below the Min Item Count.

{{image:refresh_libhistoire.jpg | refresh_libhistoire}}

The Refresh button tells LibHistoire to send all the data it has in its cache. The more data in the cache, the longer it will take to transmit.

The refresh button is only a fail safe mechanism in case a user performs the initial Ten Day scan incorrectly and the data is not sent to MM for some reason. It should not be clicked every so often or every once and a while. Clicking this does not refresh the Master Merchant window or cause the server to send any Guild History.

== Popup Item Data

{{image:popup_item_data.jpg | popup_item_data}}

This context menu is from having Master merchant and Awesome Guild Store installed. The menu will vary depending on the mods you have installed.

== Level Quality Selectors

I will try to update the selector so that there are graphics to click on but for now it is just text.

The images below show a <font class="purple">Hat of a Mother's Sorrow</font> and the Legendary version does not have buttons on the right because there is no Mythic version. The Epic version has selectors on both the left and right to view the Superior or the Legendary version.

{{note: While the selectors do not seem to be dependant on the sales in your Master Merchant Data, there may be unknown factors that prevent the selector from showing. The code is extremely old and dates back to the introduction of the Champion Points system.}}

<font class="yellow">Hat of a Mother's Sorrow</font>

== Erroneous timestamp

When you see an erroneous timestamp, LibHistoire will handle this internally. It will not be processed until the timestamp is updated properly by the server.

{{image:1657months.jpg | 1657months}}
{{image:71582789minutes.jpg | 71582789minutes}}

LibHistoire will send the sale to MM after it checks that the erroneous timestamp is no longer present.

== What is being scanned

When LibHistoire is scanning the guild history it is obtaining the sales from all the guild history that you have loaded into memory.

### A few days of sales from 109 entries

{{image:shot_history.jpg | shot_history}}

LibHistoire simply scan entries from the guild history. With another mod installed called <font class="purple">Shissu's Guild Tools</font> a count of the amount of entries is showing. As shown there are 109 entries which only covers a few minutes of sales.

### 4 days of sales from 8031 entries

{{image:long_list.jpg | shot_history}}

However, as shown in the above screen shot there are 8031 entries which covers 4 days of sales. If you feel you are missing sales from 7 days ago then you will need more sales showing on the guild history tab.

== Sales Week

As of  August 11 2020 the kiosk flip is now [[ https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/540142/updates-to-guild-trader-swap-times/p1 | every Tuesday]]. All sales totals are calculated from the time indicated by ZOS. Refer to the [[ #DateRanges | date ranges ]] section for information on the timeframes.

You should not try to calculate your sales yourself. Each sale is saved with the exact time stamp the sale occurred. All sales even a few seconds prior to the kiosk flip would not show if you selected to see sales from This Week.

{{note:On the day of the kiosk flip sales for This Week will only reset after Zenimax transmits the new kiosk flip time. This can occur several hours after the kiosk flip.}}

= Slash commands

== 3.7.x Sorting Writs by voucher count

{{note: /lgs clean, which is /LGS CLEAN but use lowercase.}}

To reorganize Writs by voucher after upgrading to 3.7.02 you need to use the slash command shown above. After the process is complete you should reload your UI.

{{note: This only applies if you are upgrading from 3.7.01 or earlier.}}

== Export Sales Report

{{image:mm_export_screen.jpg | mm_export_screen}}

Master Merchant can export a general summary of sales for use with spreadsheets. Full disclosure I am not a spreadsheet guru so I can not help with this feature. To use the export feature choose a guild to work with, then select the time and range like This Week or Last Week. Then use <code>/mm export #</code> to export the guild's information. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm export 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<font class="cyan">Without Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
["version"] = 1,
["YourGuildName"] = 
{
[1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Rank",
},
</pre>

<font class="cyan">With Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
["version"] = 1,
["YourGuildName"] = 
{
[1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Taxes&Rank",
},
</pre>

{{note: Taxes is new as of 3.2.7 and you toggle the feature on in addon settings.}}

Since I have never used this feature with a spreadsheet I do not know how easy that is to use as Lua saves it. You may need to copy and paste it into another text file and use regular expressions to clean that up.

{{note: Some of my GMs have explained if this format changed it would break what they currently use so it will not be altered.}}

== Export Sales Activity

{{image:export_sales.jpg | export_sales}}

You would use <code>/mm sales #</code> to export the sales activity. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm sales 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<pre>
["SALES"] = 
{
["version"] = 1,
["YourGuildName"] = 
{
[1] = "@Ashjunkie&@Lcs_Flores&|H0:item:46129:30:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0|h|h&200&1630085615&false&4000&Real Guild Best Guild&Quicksilver Ingot&rr01 white normal materials",
},
</pre>

== Export Personal Sales

{{image:export_personal_sales.jpg | export_sales}}

You would use <code>/mm personal #</code> to export your personal sales. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm personal 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<pre>
["PERSONALSALES"] = 
{
["version"] = 1,
["GuildName"] = 
{
[1] = "Seller&Buyer&Guild&Quantity&ItemDesc&Price&Timestamp"
},
</pre>

== Export Purchases

{{image:export_purchases.jpg | export_purchases}}

You would use <code>/mm purchases</code> to export your purchases from traders. Only the time dropdown affects the export for purchases.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<pre>
["PURCHASES"] = 
{
["version"] = 1,
["data"] = 
{
[1] = "Seller&Buyer&Guild&Quantity&ItemDesc&Price&Timestamp"
},
</pre>

= Technical Information

== Backup LibGuildStore Data

{{image:lgs_data_backup.jpg | lgs_data_backup}}

To backup your LibGuildStore data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first.

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 18 <code>GSxxData</code> files named <code>GS00Data.lua</code> to <code>GS17Data.lua</code> as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables. You will also want to keep a copy of <code>LibGuildStore.lua</code>, <code>LibHistoire.lua</code>, and <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code>.

== Uninstall Master Merchant 2.x

Currently there is some confusion about how to uninstall Master merchant 2.x and install 3.x. First you need to open minion. If you see both versions installed as shown below, uninstall both. The reason you uninstall both is because MM 3.x is a continuation of 2.x. It is the same mod with the same file names and the same folder names. Minion will not understand how to handle this.

If you manually install your mods, of if you want to know which folders belong to Master merchant, click the spoiler.

{{image:mm_remove_mod.jpg | mm_remove_mod}}

When using Minion to uninstall Master Merchant right click and choose Uninstall.

{{image:mm_remove_mod_caution.jpg | mm_remove_mod_caution}}

Do not check that box or it will remove your MM data files! Only click Delete!

{{image:mm_uninstalled.jpg | mm_uninstalled}}

As you see above, both versions of Master merchant are now uninstalled.

{{note: You have to close Minion because it will be confused about uninstalling both versions.}}

{{image:search_for_mm.jpg | search_for_mm}}

Open Minion again and click Find More and search for <code>Master Merchant 3.0</code> as shown above. Make sure the author's name is Sharlikran. Then click the Install button.

{{note: As noted on the description page you need to install LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider, LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire.}}

I won't be showing how to install all the required libraries. If you need examples images of the two new libraries LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire click the spoiler.

{{image:one_mm_only.jpg | one_mm_only}}

After you install Master Merchant 3.0 verify it is the only Master Merchant showing in Minion.

== Locating LibExecutionQueue

LibExecutionQueue is included with Master Merchant as shown in the zip below.

{{image:leq_included.jpg | leq_included}}

LibExecutionQueue is sorted alphabetically by the base game.

{{image:leq_unsorted.jpg | leq_unsorted}}

If you have LibVotansAddonList installed then it will look close to the base game.

{{image:leq_votans_sort.jpg | leq_votans_sort}}

== Unintentional ZOS Bug

{{image_thumbnail:savedvarsapostrophe.jpg | savedvarsapostrophe}}

Unfortunately from time to time ZOS introduces or reintroduces a bug in the saved vars where the apostrophe is converted to HTML code. Which will mean your sales may or may not display properly. Which is a game bug and you are out of luck until or unless they fix it.

Since this can occur I highly recommend changing your user name to only contain letters as it will make it easier for you in the long run.

This also includes creative names that contain things like Æ or æ. As those are not individual letters.

= Alternate Upgrade Method

Thanks to Shadowshire for sharing this workaround. While I did alter most of the steps I wanted to preserve his suggestion because it could provide a good alternative to importing LibHistoire data for those experiencing issues.

This alternate method will primarily use data from the old Master Merchant Data files located in SavedVariables as shown in the depreciated section, [[#|Backup Master Merchant Data]].

It is recommended that only Master Merchant 3.7.x, ShoppingList (older standalone version), the original MMxxData modules, LibGuildStore, all GSxxData modules, and the required library files for Master Merchant are enabled to avoid potential interference while this procedure is performed.

{{note: It is recommended to store any backup copies of Master Merchant data outside of SavedVariables in its own folder. For example <font class="purple">.\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Backups\MM_Backup_01</font>}}

## Optional Mods For This Procedure
* [[https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1161-CirconiansAddonSelector.html | Circonians Addon Selector]]

Circonians Addon Selector will allow you to save your current active mods before performing this procedure.

## Optional Debug Settings

The sticky post for Master Merchant 3.0 mentions some slash commands for LibDebugLogger. When these settings are changed this helps provide additional debug information in the event of any errors. Only use these slash commands as a precaution if you have been having issues upgrading.

<pre>
/debuglogger stack on
/debuglogger level debug
</pre>

{{note: You should see a confirmation of each command in the chat window. For users with chat mods installed check your mods settings. System might be redirected to other tabs such as Zone chat.}}

## The Procedure

During this procedure Master Merchant will check for duplicate sales. Please remember it is recommended that you exit the game before you install any add-on or alter the SavedVariables folder.

{{note: Version 3.7.x will not alter the previous MMxxData files or any purchase data for the older standalone ShoppingList module. If you are concerned about loosing any data then please backup your MM file as shown under [[#|Backup Master Merchant Data]]. Purchase data for the standalone ShoppingList module is located in the same folder as the Master Merchant data files in SavedVariables under the name ShoppingList.lua.}}

Remove the data file LibHistoire.lua from the SavedVariables folder. If you did not make a backup it is recommended you move the file to another location where you can find it. Depending on the results of this procedure you may want to restore it even though the primary focus is to use the older MMxxData files.

Verify you have the most recent version of Master Merchant 3.0 installed.

Log in and from the character selection screen click the dropdown for All Characters. Choose a character from the dropdown. This will be the character you log into when performing the procedure. Reduce the amount of mods running by unchecking only [[#What is required | what is required]].

{{note: If you have Circonians Addon Selector installed you will be able to enable all your preferred mods after all your data is imported.}}

After you log in and the user interface is shown, you should see Chat messages displayed by LibGuildStore and by Master Merchant, followed by one or more of the message "LibGuildStore Refresh Not Finished Yet".  Wait for until you see Master Merchant Initialized and the total Sales, Purchases, Listings, and Posted and Canceled items that are being retained.

Press ESC and go to Settings then LibGuildStore to verify that the [[#|Sales Management Options]] are configured to meet your personal preferences.

Further down under LibGuildStore settings is a button to [[#|Import MM Data]] click it and wait for the data to be imported.

Version 3.7.x was released on 09/03/21 you will not have any sales newer then Sep 3rd and because of that you will need to perform a [[#|Ten Day Scan]]. When complete you will have all the MM data that existed up until 09/03/21 and then all the sales for the last 10 days. All the data from the Ten Day Scan will be saved in LibHistoire. As long as you [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] you will begin to accumulate data the same as you did with 3.5.x.

{{note: At this point you can also [[#|Import ATT Data]] if that is available to you.}}

You will also want to [[#|Import Pricing Data]] and [[#|Import ShoppingList Data]] as well.

If you chose to use the debuglogger slash commands and you did not encounter any errors then it is recommended that you type into chat <font class="tan"> /debuglogger level info</font> to avoid having unneeded debug messages from mods that use LibDebugLogger to output detailed debug messages. These detailed debug messages are not needed during normal operation.

At this point you will have to log out to the character screen and enable your preferred mods or use Circonians Addon Selector and restore the saved package of add-ons that you normally use.

{{note: If they are enabled, then disable the add-on ShoppingList, and each of the Master Merchant Data File MM00Data through Master Merchant Data File MM16Data files in the Libraries section to decrease load times}}. 

This will leave you with a gap in your sales from 09/03/21 until now. If that gap is too much for you then you can try to import your old LibHistoire information. To do that you will need to exit the game, backup your LibGuildStore data and your current LibHistoire data. Once you restore the copy of your old LibHistoire data that you moved to a safe place attempt to [[#|Refresh LibHistoire]] again. If you do not have better results then exit the game, restore your LibGuildStore and LibHistoire backups and you won't be able to use the old LibHistoire data.

= Version History

Apparently for version 2.2.0 there was an experimental turbo mode added to MM. From the change log it appears that this was removed by request from Zenimax. However, even I noticed when you tried to download 2.2.1 which had turbo mode removed, you received a file named <font class="purple">Master Merchant 2.2.0.zip</font>. If you tried to engage turbo mode it was still available even if it didn't work as expected.

Aug 01 2020 after the kiosk flip was announced Philgo68 posted that he would be uploading a new version, which would be 2.3.1. From the start it had a small bug in it that prevented it from working. Then after that was fixed people started reporting that the Master Merchant window would not update when you were viewing your personal sales but that all guild sales was still updating properly.

Upon examination of the code 2.3.1 had turbo mode removed which was not really removed in 2.2.1 (2.2.0). In addition to that on the description page it was mentioned that there was Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning. Oddly those options included new options in the Addons menu to toggle the features on and off. These options were not present in 2.2.1.

This makes me believe that 2.3.1 was really intended to be the proposed 2.2.1 but somehow the upload never went through properly. I am glad Philgo68 uploaded the version as it has helped me understand the code a bit more.

== Backup Master Merchant Data

{{image:mm_data_backup.jpg | mm_data_backup}}

To backup your Master Merchant data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first. 

{{note: I am sorry I don't know where it is located on a Mac.}}

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 17 MMxxData files named MM00Data.lua to MM16Data.lua as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables.

== Background Scanning

As of version 3.0.0 there is no <code>/mm missing</code> and no background scan. The background scan would get hung up by repeated attempts to request more sales data from the server. When the server denied the request MM would continue to wait for the request to be approved.

After starting a new library [[https://github.com/ESOUIMods/LibGuildHistoryCache | LibGuildHistoryCache]] I observed that the cache mod would see some new sales. Usually there were only a few sales maybe 1 or 2 and occasionally less then 10. The cache mod would update showing that the guild history events were not duplicates but MM would not see them as new sales. 

One other calculation previous versions of MM made was to try and get the first entry in the guild history and the last. This was used to attempt to determine whether or not to scan from the start of the guild history array, or the end. Whether or not you have 1, 100, or more then 1000 events the first event will always be the same. All guild history events are appended onto the end of the list.

For reasons like these MM no longer uses a background scan as it attempted to scan from a specific point in time and loop over the guild history events.
