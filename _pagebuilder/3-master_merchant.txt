{{image:Bonanza.png | Bonanza}}

Shop all of Tamriel with [[https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2143-BeamMeUp-TeleporterFastTravel.html | Beam Me Up]] and Bonanza. Master Merchant is not just for high end traders anymore. If you are shopping for the best deal you can find it in the Bonanza window.

= Upgrading from 3.5.30 to 3.6.x

==  What steps should I take when upgrading

* Log out of the game
* Download the MM 3.6.x update with Minion or manually install it
  * If you manually install then manually delete the previous version first
* Log into the game to the character screen
* Before choosing a character make sure all the new [[#All the LibGuildStore Modules | LibGuildStore]] modules and all the old MMxxData modules are active
* Once you log in you will see a notification in chat <font class="yellow">LibGuildStore Refresh Not Finished yet</font>. Wait for LibGuildStore to recieve all of the LibHistoire data.  
* Verify the [[#Sales Management Options | LibGuildStore settings]] are configured to meet your personal preferences.
* Use LibGuildStore to [[#Import MM Data | import data from MM]] or to [[#Import ATT Data | import data from ATT]]
* Use LibGuildStore to [[#Import Pricing Data | Import Pricing Data]] and review the [[#Guild Store Options | Guild Store Options]] for changes
* Disable all [[#disablemmmodules | old MM modules]] and the old standalone ShoppingList after the data is imported to decrease load times
 
{{note: You can still use ATT and MM at the same time if you chose. There is a toggle to disable the notification under <font class="purple">Debug Options</font> under the [[#MM Debug Options | MasterMerchat settings]].}}

### What is required

* Master Merchant 3.6.x
* LibGuildStore
* LibGuildStore Data File GS00Data, LibGuildStore Data File GS01Data, etc.

### What is optional after importing

Master Merchant Data File MM00Data, Master Merchant Data File MM01Data, etc.
ShoppingList

== What to expect upgrading from 3.5.30 to 3.6.x

{{image:startup_refresh.jpg | startup_refresh}}

There will be a long Refresh once you log in while all the sales from LibHistorie are imported. It took about one hour and eight minutes to import 1,110,000 sales. I will look into reducing the amount of time it takes but for now that is a good estimate for you. If you have about 1M records expect it to take an hour to import sales from LibHistorie.

Once the initial refresh is finished you can import sales from MM. This is to accommodate people who may have more history in their MM data files then they do in LibHistorie. You can also import from ATT for the same reason. If you have been using ATT and have never used MM then you could have 30 days of data in your ATT data files. After you import your ATT data and do a Ten Day with LibHistorie you will have the most data possible. You can also import purchases from ATT and the old standalone ShoppingList for MM. There will be notifications to disable the old MMxxData modules, the old ShoppingList standalone module, and ATT. There is an option to disable the ATT notification if you prefer to use both MM and ATT at the same time.

==  Have the dependencies changed

{{note: LibGuildStore is provided with MM and is not a separate Minion download.}}

MM Adds LibGuildStore which is where all the Guild Store related data will be kept. NA and EU information is now stored separately. This also allows importing from MM if you have more MM data then you do LibHistoire data. You would not want to overload MM but you could import any backups you have or backup files from other friends or guild members if you copy them to the SavedVariables folder.

{{note: <font class="yellow">Caution</font>, the more data you import the longer MM will need to load.}}

== Which modules do I need to activate for MM 3.6.x

### Master Merchant and ShoppingList

{{image:mm_shopping_list.jpg | mm_shopping_list}}

### All the LibGuildStore Modules

{{image:all_libguildstore_modules.jpg | all_libguildstore_modules}}

### LibHistoire and all MMxxData Modules

{{image:lh_mmdata_modules.jpg | lh_mmdata_modules}}

{{note: Because of how saved variables work I am forced to keep the old MMxxData modules to load the data into memory. Because of how Minion handles uninstalling I chose not to move the MM modules to a different subfolder.}}

= Shopping List and Bonanza!

## Shopping List

{{image:shopping_list_view.jpg | shopping_list_view}}

Adds a new icon allowing you to view purchases you make from guild stores.

{{inline:24px | shopping_list.jpg | shopping_list}} The <font class="tan">Shopping List</font> icon allows you to select the installed extension and view purchases you have made from guild stores.

{{note: The by old Shopping List extension by MildFlavour is not longer used and can be disabled after you import your purchases.}}

## Bonanza!

{{image:bonanza_window.jpg | bonanza_window}}

With MM 3.6.x the Bonanza {{inline:24px | bonanza_icon.jpg | bonanza_icon}} icon allows you to view items you have seen at traders as you shop for items to purchase.

## Bonanza Name Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter.jpg | bonanza_window_filter}}

## Bonanza Type Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter_type.jpg | bonanza_window_filter_type}}

== LibGuildStore for Master Merchant

LibGuildStore was created to facilitate converting MM sales data from the old format to a new format that uses less space. LGS will also keep track of purchases for the Shopping List module, sold and canceled items, and contains listings from other traders. Bonanza will provide you with a snapshot of the last 24 hours of items you have seen when visiting traders. LibGuildStore also keeps all information separate between NA and EU servers.

For those upgrading to MM 3.6.x you will need to be aware of a few changes.  The MMxxData (MM00Data, MM01Data, etc.) modules are used for importing data only. After your import your data, these old modules should be deactivated.

= MM Price vs TTC vs Bonanza 

{{inline:256px | example_1_hlaalu.jpg | example_1_hlaalu}}{{inline:256px | example_2_cuirass.jpg | example_2_cuirass}}{{inline:256px | example_3_bow.jpg | example_3_bow}}{{inline:256px | example_4_plating.jpg | example_4_plating}}

* The MM price is in <font class="yellow">yellow text</font>, and it is the price the item sold for in one of the guilds you are in. It is not a price from other outside sources like other guilds on the server and it is not from TTC.
* The TTC Price is from their own data collected by their EXE and transmitted to their server. They trim outliers using their own method and then make an average of the remaining data.
* The Bonanza Price is in <font class="blue">blue text</font> and it is an average from a 24 hour snapshot of all the listings you have seen of that specific item from the traders you have visited.

Looking at the first example of the Hlaalu Bookcase you see it sold 1 time out of all the guilds I am in. So there is no way to get a reasonable price for it. Someone listed it 56 days ago for 100K and it sold. That is one of the drawbacks of the MM price. If you do not have many sales from the guilds you are in then the MM price won't be very helpful. Also from the first example you see that the TTC price is about 19K and the Bonanza price is 17K. There are 9 listings from TTC and 1 from another trader. Once you have more data the Bonanza price may change but you can more easily see that 17K to 19K would probably be a more reasonable price then 100K.

From the second and third examples you will note that the TTC price is useless for these items.  The TTC price can sometimes be very helpful. The bonanza price is also higher then the MM price. This is where the Bonanza window will be needed because you will need to search for the exact item and look at the prices you have found. This is discussed in the section [[#Evaluating the Bonanza price | Evaluating the Bonanza price]]

The Bonanza price while similar to TTC is the average of what you have found at the traders you have visited in the last 24 hours. Bonanza itself is intended to be a shopping tool but since the data is there it is displayed on the graph for you to use as another way to evaluate what the item is currently selling for. If you only have 1 to 3 sales you can not compute an average from that I'd suggest 5 or more depending on how popular it is on traders at the time.

For the last example you will note that the Bonanza price for Chromium Plating is only about 22K above the MM price. With more data it may even fall exactly in line with the MM price. The TTC suggested price is 239Kwhich is 2K different then the Bonanza average. For items that normally do not have a lot of skew to the pricing data this will be common. For items that have more outliers skewing the pricing data you will need to evaluate the TTC and Bonanza prices to get a better idea of what may be a good price to sell the item for.

## Evaluating the Bonanza price

{{inline:256px | bonanza_tooltip_style_page.jpg | bonanza_tooltip_style_page}}{{inline:512px | low_end_prices.jpg | low_end_prices}}{{inline:512px | high_end_prices.jpg | high_end_prices}}

{{note: If those are too small, right click the image and show it in a new tab to see the full size.}}

Looking at the tooltip TTC shows 74K to 93K, the Bonanza average is 158K, and the MM price is 70K. Then the highest and lowest listing in TTC is 446 to 5M. With TTC you can not view the current prices being used for their suggestion. You can view the Bonanza prices to evaluate what other people are selling the item for. For this example you would open the Bonanza window and search for <font class="tan">style zero cuirass</font>.

As you see in the middle screenshot the prices range from 50K to 80K. In the last screen shot the highest prices are 1M to 3.9M.  So now you have three prices all in about the same range. 1) 50K to 80K 2) 70K 3) 74 to 93K and all without opening external websites, google docs pages, or spreadsheets. It didn't require two monitors and it took only a few moments.

It is easy to see that 70K is probably the best average price to sell the style page for. If you want it to see faster because you want it out of your inventory, 50K won't bee too low that someone might flip it and even if they do you still made close to the going rate of 70K.

{{note: Just because the Bonanza price is not 70K and is showing 158K doesn't mean it is inaccurate. In this example it is being affected by all the prices above 1M. Although you can not see the data you will be able to view your own. For the data used in the screen shots 99 of the prices were above 100K which will affect the average significantly. This is why I recommend you evaluate the price in the manner described.}}

## Price Sold vs. Price Listed

The above items are meant to show items that have an unusual range for the TTC price or Bonanza price because it is the listed price. For items like style pages if there are 124 listings and 99 of them are 100K and above you may wonder if you could make more from selling the item. Maybe and maybe not. This is the difference between what the item sold for which is the MM price and what the item is listed for which it the Bonanza or TTC price. Think of how an author might write a book. They write the book so it is appealing to their audience. So imagine who will be buying your items. Do they have 6M to spend on something and plenty of gold left over? Does your buyer have 6M at all? Have they ever had 6M at one time? Are they willing to spend 6M for the item? It is simple common sense that if someone has 124 items to choose from they will buy the cheapest one. Just because something sold for 5M or 6M 60 days ago when the item was scarce and someone had that much to spend on the item doesn't mean people will pay that price when the item is less scarce.

The above examples don't represent things like crafting materials where the pricing is more consistent and the MM price is more reliable. With the example of crafting materials that is simple supply and demand. If you want to read an article on it be my guest and you can enjoy such wonderful words as equilibrium and elasticity, knock yourself out. There are a lot of crafting materials on guild stores so there is a large supply and there is a large demand for them. Because there is a consistent need for them people purchase the cheapest listed items and the price remains rather consistent. 

This is not the case for everything. Take your time and use the different prices and tools to evaluate what you are selling, what others are selling it for, and what others are buying it for.

= Three states of LibHistoire cache

## Unlinked

{{image:red_text_unlinked.jpg | red_text_unlinked}}

In the Unlinked state you can either wait for the server to grant the requests for offline data that LibHistoire requests, or you can manually request guild history for the time you were offline.

## Linking in progress

{{image:yellow_text_linking.jpg | yellow_text_linking}}

Once LibHistoire has what it feels it needs, then it will begin processing the guild history events and attempt to link to the last known event.

## Linked

{{image:green_text_linked.jpg | green_text_linked}}

Once LibHistoire has linked to its stored events you should see green text. This means that LibHistoire has finished processing the guild history.

{{note: You can still request additional history and ask LibHistoire to check the guild history for any missing sales events using the rescan button.}}

= Ten Day Scan

After upgrading to 3.x you will need to do a Ten Day Scan of all the guilds you are in. This ensures that LibHistoire has stored sales data for you to start working with. After doing a ten day scan for each guild you only need to request guild history for the time you have been offline.

{{note: Initially I had suggested requesting all the data at once. This seems to cause an issue for some users. Read this section carefully.}}

## Select A Guild

When you first log in there won’t be much as far as guild history loaded in memory.

{{image:show_more.jpg | show_more}}

In order to manually request sales data you have to choose a guild and select All, not purchases. Then press E about every 3 seconds so you are not kicked from the game by the server.

## Request only a few days at a time

{{image:one_day_of_data.jpg | one_day_of_data}}

You should be able to request two or three days of guild history at once. However, some users have seen issues requesting too much at one time. Each time you request a few days of data stop and, click the Rescan button.

## Rescan Button

{{image:ten_day_scan_refresh.jpg | ten_day_scan_refresh}}

The Rescan button is the equivalent of the old <code>/mm missing</code> and it will scan all the data loaded into memory so far. LibHistoire will skip any duplicate events as it scans guild history.

## When E is no longer showing

{{image:10_days_sales.jpg | show_more}}

Once you have scanned 10 days of sales then the option to press E will not be shown. The server will only allow you to request 10 days of data. Once you have done so click the [[#|Rescan Button]] to make sure LibHistoire processes all the events.

## LibHistoire GUI

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

As you perform a ten day scan the LibHistoire GUI will update. It might even finish processing a certain amount of events. Do not click the small chain link showing in this screen shot. That will link to the current events loaded which for your first initial use of LibHistoire you do not want that to happen. You should only click the [[#|Rescan Button]] if you see it to ensure all events are scanned.

{{note:Scanning 10 days of history every few days or every week is pointless and a drain on the server.}}

= Update Your Guild History Each Day

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

Regardless of how long you have been offline you need to update your guild history. To obtain older sales data for any time you have been offline you can wait for the server to send the data to LibHistoire. How quickly the server provides the data depends on many things. Because of that I do not wait. I manually scan the guild history from the guild history tab by [[#Select A Guild | pressing E for Show More]].

After I have enough guild history to cover the time I have been offline then I use the rescan button which asks LibHistoire to double check the sales loaded in memory are in the cache. Once LibHistoire has verified the sales data the text will turn green indicating that the [[#Linked | sales events are linked]].

= Unlinked Events Notification

With LibHistoire 1.2.0 there is a new notification when you log off.

{{image:log_off_notification.jpg | log_off_notification}}

You could have any amount of time that has not been linked with your Guild History Events. If you chose to log off that is fine but pay close attention to the notification. Any gap in information will still be there when you log back in and you will have to start over. Refer to [[#|Resolving Unlinked Events]] and [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] for more information.

{{note:If you open the Guild History have more then 10 days of missing events you will need to complete a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].}}

= Resolving Unlinked Events

{{image:unlinked_sales.jpg | unlinked_sales}}

The above screen shot indicates that there is 28 days and 19 hours worth of missing time from unlinked events. When this happens you can only fix it by doing a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].

To start request one day of data as shown in the screen shot for [[#|Request only a few days at a time]]. After you see one day of data then click the small chain link above sales as shown below.

{{image:chain_link.jpg | chain_link}}

After you click the chain link then you will be given a confirmation screen and you will want to click Confirm or press E to confirm the action.

{{image-caption:confirm_forcing.jpg | confirm_forcing | Since the server only stores 10 days of data, you will not be able to retrieve sales more then 10 days old.}}

Once the chain link is clicked LibHistoire will begin processing sales for the time you have loaded into memory. If you have done as suggested, it will process about 1 days worth of sales.

Then repeat the process mentioned in the [[#|Ten Day Scan]] by requesting a day or two of data and then click the small [[#|Rescan Button]]. Once the process is complete then remember to [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] so this doesn't happen again.

{{note: This can happen in any guild however, this will occur in guilds with a high volume of sales per day more easily then in a guild with smaller amounts of sales.}}

== Guild Sales and Personal Sales

{{inline:175px | show_your_info.jpg | show_your_info}}{{inline:175px | show_all_info.jpg | show_all_info}}

First select what information you would like to see. <font class="tan">Show Personal Sales</font> will display info ONLY about You. <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font> will display data from all members of all of your guilds.

{{note: When the button says <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font>, that means you are currently viewing <font class="tan">YOUR</font> information and vice-versa. You can toggle back and forth between <font class="tan">Personal Sales</font> and <font class="tan">Guild Sales</font> while viewing any report.}}

== Item Report

{{image:item_report.jpg | item_report}}

If you have ever opened the Master Merchant window you have probably seen the list of your personal sales. This is an Item Report and if you click the [[#|People Icon]] you will change between the Buyer and the Seller.

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Buyer</font>: The purchaser of the item.
* <font class="tan">Guild</font>: The guild associated with the sale of the item.
* <font class="tan">Item Sold</font>: To the left of the Item Sold is the items icon. The number indicates how many of that item was sold.
* <font class="tan">Sale Time</font>: The approximate time the item was sold. The game stores all sales using epoch time so the UI just approximates the sale after the first hour.
* <font class="tan">Price</font>: The price the item sold for. You can view the individual price by clicking the Show Unit Price button.

{{inline:132px | show_unit_price.jpg | show_unit_price}} Toggle between the Unit Price and Total Sale.

== Seller's Report

{{note: You can also view a Seller's Report for your personal sales only the items will be <font class="tan">YOUR</font> top selling items.}}
{{note: Clicking the People Icon will cycle through Seller, Buyer, and Item Sold.}}

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Rank</font>: The rank of the member or item for the guild listed. For example, if you are viewing a <font class="tan">seller's</font> report and your rank is <font class="tan">7</font>, it means you are the <font class="tan">7th</font> biggest <font class="tan">seller</font> in the guild for the time selected. If you are viewing an <font class="tan">item</font> report for and <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">1st</font> item in the list, then <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">biggest seller</font> for the guild showing.
* <font class="tan">Sales/Purchases</font>: Total Sales or Purchases for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Tax</font>: Total Tax generated for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Count</font>: The number on the left is the number of <font class="tan">transactions</font>, while the number on the right is the number of <font class="tan">items</font>. For example @TradingDude had <font class="yellow">10 Dreugh Wax</font> <font class="tan">transactions</font> and sold <font class="yellow">100 Dreugh wax</font> <font class="tan">total</font>.
* <font class="tan">Percent</font>: This shows what percent of total guild sales or purchases each member is responsible for.

== Date Ranges

{{image:time_frames.jpg | time_frames}}

There are several date ranges you can choose from. <font class="tan">This Week</font>, <font class="tan">Last Week</font> and <font class="tan">Prior Week</font> start from the ZOS trader flip for the current [[#|Sales Week]]. However, the last option is customizable under the Master Merchant settings under [[#|Calculation And Tip Options]].

Meaning if you have 1001 sales for an item, 1 will be trimmed and 100 will remain.
* <font class="tan">Minimal Indexing</font>: Does not add search words for items. It only adds the player search word for displaying personal sales. Searching in the Master merchant window is still possible but will take extra time.

=== Refresh LibHistoire

{{image:refresh_libhistoire.jpg | refresh_libhistoire}}

The Refresh button tells LibHistoire to send all the data it has in its cache. The more data in the cache, the longer it will take to transmit.

The refresh button is only a fail safe mechanism in case a user performs the initial Ten Day scan incorrectly and the data is not sent to MM for some reason. It should not be clicked every so often or every once and a while. Clicking this does not refresh the Master Merchant window or cause the server to send any Guild History.

== Popup Item Data

{{image:popup_item_data.jpg | popup_item_data}}

This context menu is from having Master merchant and Awesome Guild Store installed. The menu will vary depending on the mods you have installed.

== Level Quality Selectors

I will try to update the selector so that there are graphics to click on but for now it is just text.

The images below show a <font class="purple">Hat of a Mother's Sorrow</font> and the Legendary version does not have buttons on the right because there is no Mythic version. The Epic version has selectors on both the left and right to view the Superior or the Legendary version.

{{note: While the selectors do not seem to be dependant on the sales in your Master Merchant Data, there may be unknown factors that prevent the selector from showing. The code is extremely old and dates back to the introduction of the Champion Points system.}}

== Erroneous timestamp

When you see an erroneous timestamp, LibHistoire will handle this internally. It will not be processed until the timestamp is updated properly by the server.

{{image:1657months.jpg | 1657months}}
{{image:71582789minutes.jpg | 71582789minutes}}

LibHistoire will send the sale to MM after it checks that the erroneous timestamp is no longer present.

== What is being scanned

When LibHistoire is scanning the guild history it is obtaining the sales from all the guild history that you have loaded into memory.

### A few days of sales from 109 entries

{{image:shot_history.jpg | shot_history}}

LibHistoire simply scan entries from the guild history. With another mod installed called <font class="purple">Shissu's Guild Tools</font> a count of the amount of entries is showing. As shown there are 109 entries which only covers a few minutes of sales.

### 4 days of sales from 8031 entries

{{image:long_list.jpg | shot_history}}

However, as shown in the above screen shot there are 8031 entries which covers 4 days of sales. If you feel you are missing sales from 7 days ago then you will need more sales showing on the guild history tab.

== Sales Week

As of  August 11 2020 the kiosk flip is now [[ https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/540142/updates-to-guild-trader-swap-times/p1 | every Tuesday]]. All sales totals are calculated from the time indicated by ZOS.

You should not try to calculate your sales yourself. Each sale is saved with the exact time stamp the sale occurred. All sales even a few seconds prior to the kiosk flip would not show if you selected to see sales from This Week.

{{note:On the day of the kiosk flip sales for This Week will only reset after Zenimax transmits the new kiosk flip time. This can occur several hours after the kiosk flip.}}

== Export Sales Report

{{image:mm_export_screen.jpg | mm_export_screen}}

Master Merchant can export a general summary of sales for use with spreadsheets. Full disclosure I am not a spreadsheet guru so I can not help with this feature. To use the export feature choose a guild to work with, then select the time and range like This Week or Last Week. Then use <code>/mm export #</code> to export the guild's information. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm export 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<font class="cyan">Without Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
    ["version"] = 1,
    ["YourGuildName"] = 
    {
        [1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Rank",
    },
</pre>

<font class="cyan">With Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
    ["version"] = 1,
    ["YourGuildName"] = 
    {
        [1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Taxes&Rank",
    },
</pre>

{{note: Taxes is new as of 3.2.7 and you toggle the feature on in addon settings.}}

Since I have never used this feature with a spreadsheet I do not know how easy that is to use as Lua saves it. You may need to copy and paste it into another text file and use regular expressions to clean that up.

{{note: Some of my GMs have explained if this format changed it would break what they currently use so it will not be altered.}}

== Export Sales Activity

{{image:export_sales.jpg | export_sales}}

You would use <code>/mm sales #</code> to export the sales activity. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm sales 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<pre>
["SALES"] = 
{
    ["version"] = 1,
    ["YourGuildName"] = 
    {
        [1] = "@Ashjunkie&@Lcs_Flores&|H0:item:46129:30:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0|h|h&200&1630085615&false&4000&Real Guild Best Guild&Quicksilver Ingot&rr01 white normal materials",
    },

== Backup LibGuildStore Data

{{image:lgs_data_backup.jpg | lgs_data_backup}}

To backup your LibGuildStore data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first. 

{{note: I am sorry I don't know where it is located on a Mac.}}

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 16 <code>GSxxData</code> files named <code>GS00Data.lua</code> to <code>GS15Data.lua</code> as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables. You will also want to keep a copy of <code>LibGuildStore.lua</code>, <code>LibHistoire.lua</code>, and <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code>.

== Backup Master Merchant Data

{{image:mm_data_backup.jpg | mm_data_backup}}

To backup your Master Merchant data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first. 

{{note: I am sorry I don't know where it is located on a Mac.}}

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 16 MMxxData files named MM00Data.lua to MM15Data.lua as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables.

== Uninstall Master Merchant 2.x

Currently there is some confusion about how to uninstall Master merchant 2.x and install 3.x. First you need to open minion. If you see both versions installed as shown below, uninstall both. The reason you uninstall both is because MM 3.x is a continuation of 2.x. It is the same mod with the same file names and the same folder names. Minion will not understand how to handle this.

{{image:both_mm_installed.jpg | both_mm_installed}}

If you manually install your mods, of if you want to know which folders belong to Master merchant, click the spoiler.

[[sb:Spoiler4 | Master Merchant Folders]]
{{image-caption:mm_files_installed.jpg | mm_files_installed | To see a larger image, right click the image and choose View Image.}}
[[se:]]

{{image:mm_remove_mod.jpg | mm_remove_mod}}

When using Minion to uninstall Master Merchant right click and choose Uninstall.

{{image:mm_remove_mod_caution.jpg | mm_remove_mod_caution}}

Do not check that box or it will remove your MM data files! Only click Delete!

{{image:mm_uninstalled.jpg | mm_uninstalled}}

As you see above, both versions of Master merchant are now uninstalled.

{{note: You have to close Minion because it will be confused about uninstalling both versions.}}

{{image:search_for_mm.jpg | search_for_mm}}

Open Minion again and click Find More and search for <code>Master Merchant 3.0</code> as shown above. Make sure the author's name is Sharlikran. Then click the Install button.

{{note: As noted on the description page you need to install LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider, LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire.}}

I won't be showing how to install all the required libraries. If you need examples images of the two new libraries LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire click the spoiler.

[[sb:Spoiler5 | New Libraries]]
{{image-caption:install_LibGuildRoster.jpg | install_LibGuildRoster | To see a larger image, right click the image and choose View Image.}}

{{image-caption:install_LibHistoire.jpg | install_LibHistoire | To see a larger image, right click the image and choose View Image.}}

{{image:one_mm_only.jpg | one_mm_only}}

After you install Master Merchant 3.0 verify it is the only Master Merchant showing in Minion.

== Locating LibExecutionQueue

LibExecutionQueue is included with Master Merchant as shown in the zip below.

{{image:leq_included.jpg | leq_included}}

LibExecutionQueue is sorted alphabetically by the base game.

{{image:leq_unsorted.jpg | leq_unsorted}}

If you have LibVotansAddonList installed then it will look close to the base game.

{{image:leq_votans_sort.jpg | leq_votans_sort}}

== Background Scanning Depreciated

As of version 3.0.0 there is no <code>/mm missing</code> and no background scan. The background scan would get hung up by repeated attempts to request more sales data from the server. When the server denied the request MM would continue to wait for the request to be approved.

After starting a new library [[https://github.com/ESOUIMods/LibGuildHistoryCache | LibGuildHistoryCache]] I observed that the cache mod would see some new sales. Usually there were only a few sales maybe 1 or 2 and occasionally less then 10. The cache mod would update showing that the guild history events were not duplicates but MM would not see them as new sales. 

One other calculation made was to try and get the first entry in the guild history and the last. This was used to attempt to determine whether or not to scan from the start of the guild history array, or the end. Whether or not you have 1, 100, or more then 1000 events the first event will always be the same. All guild history events are appended onto the end of the list.

For reasons like these MM no longer uses a background scan as it attempted to scan from a specific point in time and loop over the guild history events.

== Unintentional ZOS Bug

{{image-thumbnail:savedvarsapostrophe.jpg | savedvarsapostrophe}}

Unfortunately from time to time ZOS introduces or reintroduces a bug in the saved vars where the apostrophe is converted to HTML code. Which will mean your sales may or may not display properly. Which is a game bug and you are out of luck until or unless they fix it.

Since this can occur I highly recommend changing your user name to only contain letters as it will make it easier for you in the long run.

This also includes creative names that contain things like Æ or æ. As those are not individual letters.

== Version History

Apparently for version 2.2.0 there was an experimental turbo mode added to MM. From the change log it appears that this was removed by request from Zenimax. However, even I noticed when you tried to download 2.2.1 which had turbo mode removed, you received a file named <font class="purple">Master Merchant 2.2.0.zip</font>. If you tried to engage turbo mode it was still available even if it didn't work as expected.

Aug 01 2020 after the kiosk flip was announced Philgo68 posted that he would be uploading a new version, which would be 2.3.1. From the start it had a small bug in it that prevented it from working. Then after that was fixed people started reporting that the Master Merchant window would not update when you were viewing your personal sales but that all guild sales was still updating properly.

Upon examination of the code 2.3.1 had turbo mode removed which was not really removed in 2.2.1 (2.2.0). In addition to that on the description page it was mentioned that there was Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning. Oddly those options included new options in the Addons menu to toggle the features on and off. These options were not present in 2.2.1.

This makes me believe that 2.3.1 was really intended to be the proposed 2.2.1 but somehow the upload never went through properly. I am glad Philgo68 uploaded the version as it has helped me understand the code a bit more.
