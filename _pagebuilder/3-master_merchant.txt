=== Displaying a percentage of time

Would it be possible to add back the scan % messages back to the verbose modes?
[[be:]]
 It has not been removed. It only happens durring the background scan.

The method I used in the past for loading sales data for the period between my last login and my current login was to set verbosity to 4 so I could see the % of each guild scan. I would then run through each guild history sales (by pressing E) until MM showed 100% for that guild (I am never offline for more than 3 days so I always had full data). Once it hit 100% for a guild I would do the next guild. The entire process took less than a minute (despite being in several major trade guilds) and it always gave me full data each day.

The current message is not any indication that there is a certain ammount of time being scaned.

=== It takes too long to scan

You can not request data faster.

=== New API 2021

There has never been any way to scan a range of data. You get the initial 100 most recent sales, and then you can request more older sales. To do so press E on the guild history tab.

=== older data unchanged

I can scan days of history once a week.
[[be:]]

There is no point in doing this as you have already seen the data unless you didn't log in enough to keep your data up to date.

=== older in time

{{image:older_in_time.jpg | older_in_time}}

The server gives you older data when you request it by pressing E on the guild history tab. New sales are received when the server provides them. 

=== Reload UI

Reloading the UI does not reset the history.

=== Streaming Data

It worked fine this morning, but when I log in now, it tells me for 4 of my 5 guilds "Guild XY has no sales" (verbose 4) even though they are all trading guilds. Is there way to fix this? There should be several hundred new sales to scan.

I have no idea how else am I supposed to get any sales when MM got to about five hours worth of history in several hours of the game sitting idle. 
[[be:]]
MM can not request data like a streaming video server. If you do not have several hundred sales to scan in your guild history then you will not see the updates you expect.
