= Version History

Apparently for version 2.2.0 there was an experimental turbo mode added to MM. From the change log it appears that this was removed by request from Zenimax. However, even I noticed when you tried to download 2.2.1 which had turbo mode removed, you received a file named <font class="purple">Master Merchant 2.2.0.zip</font>. If you tried to engage turbo mode it was still available even if it didn't work as expected.

Aug 01 2020 after the kiosk flip was announced Philgo68 posted that he would be uploading a new version, which would be 2.3.1. From the start it had a small bug in it that prevented it from working. Then after that was fixed people started reporting that the Master Merchant window would not update when you were viewing your personal sales but that all guild sales was still updating properly.

Upon examination of the code 2.3.1 had turbo mode removed which was not really removed in 2.2.1 (2.2.0). In addition to that on the description page it was mentioned that there was Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning. Oddly those options included new options in the Addons menu to toggle the features on and off. These options were not present in 2.2.1.

This makes me believe that 2.3.1 was really intended to be the proposed 2.2.1 but somehow the upload never went through properly. I am glad Philgo68 uploaded the version as it has helped me understand the code a bit more.

= Upgrading from 3.5.30 to 3.6.x

==  What steps should I take when upgrading

* Log out of the game
* Download the MM 3.6.x update with Minion or manually install it
  * If you manually install then manually delete the previous version first
* Log into the game to the character screen
* Before choosing a character make sure all the new LibGuildStore modules and all the old MMxxData modules are active
 
==  Have the dependencies changed

{{note: LibGuildStore is provided with MM and is not a separate Minion download.}}

MM Adds LibGuildStore which is where all the Guild Store related data will be kept. This also allows importing from MM if you have more MM data then you do LibHistoire data. You would not want to overload MM but you could install any backups you have or backup files from other friends or guild members.

{{note: <font class="yellow">Caution</font>, the more data you import the longer MM will need to load.}}

== Which modules do I need to activate for MM 3.6.x

# Master Merchant and ShoppingList

{{image:mm_shopping_list.jpg | mm_shopping_list}}

# All the LibGuildStore Modules

{{image:all_libguildstore_modules.jpg | all_libguildstore_modules}}

# LibHistoire and all MMxxData Modules

{{image:lh_mmdata_modules.jpg | lh_mmdata_modules}}

{{note: Because of how saved variables work I am forced to keep the old MMxxData modules to load the data into memory. Because of how Minion handles uninstalling I chose not to move the MM modules to a different subfolder.}}

== First What to expect upgrading from 3.5.30 to 3.6.x

{{image:startup_refresh.jpg | startup_refresh}}

There will be a long Refresh once you log in while all the sales from LibHistorie are imported. It took about one hour and eight minutes to import 1,110,000 sales. I will look into reducing the amount of time it takes but for now that is a good estimate for you. If you have about 1M records expect it to take an hour to import sales from LibHistorie.

Once the initial refresh is finished you can import sales from MM. This is to accommodate people who may have more history in their MM data files then they do in LibHistorie. You can also import from ATT for the same reason. If you have been using ATT and have never used MM then you could have 30 days of data in your ATT data files. After you import your ATT data and do a Ten Day with LibHistorie you will have the most data possible. You can also import purchases from ATT and the old standalone ShoppingList for MM. There will be notifications to disable the old MMxxData modules, the old ShoppingList standalone module, and ATT. There is an option to disable the ATT notification if you prefer to use both MM and ATT at the same time.

= Master Merchant Extensions

## Shopping List

{{image:shopping_list_view.jpg | shopping_list_view}}

Adds a new icon allowing you to view purchases you make from guild stores.

{{inline:24px | shopping_list.jpg | shopping_list}} The <font class="tan">Shopping List</font> icon allows you to select the installed extension and view purchases you have made from guild stores.

{{note: The by old Shopping List extension by MildFlavour is not longer used and can be disabled after you import your purchases.}}

## Bonanza!

{{image:bonanza_window.jpg | bonanza_window}}

With MM 3.6.x Bonanza adds a new icon allowing you to view items you have seen at traders as you shop for items to purchase.

## Bonanza Name Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter.jpg | bonanza_window_filter}}

## Bonanza Type Filter

{{image:bonanza_window_filter_type.jpg | bonanza_window_filter_type}}

= LibGuildStore for Master Merchant

LibGuildStore was created to facilitate converting MM sales data from the old format to a new format that uses less space. LGS will also keep track of purchases for the Shopping List module, sold and canceled items, and contains listings from other traders. Bonanza will provide you with a snapshot of the last 24 hours of items you have seen when visiting traders.

For those upgrading to MM 3.6.x you will need to be aware of a few changes.

* The first run of MM and LibGuildStore will take a while LibHistoire processes all the sales data.
  * MM and ATT data are not automatically imported
* [[#Data Management Options | Data Management]] settings is now under LibGuildStore
* the MMxxData (MM00Data, MM01Data, etc.) modules are used for importing data only
* LGS stores all sales from LibHistoire
* LibGuildStore allows you to import from LibHistoire using the Refresh option, and you may import sales and purchaces from MM or ATT

[[sb:Spoiler1 | Disable MM Modules]]
{{image:disable_mm.jpg | disable_mm}}
[[se:]]

= Scanning 

== Background Scanning Depreciated

As of version 3.0.0 there is no <code>/mm missing</code> and no background scan. The background scan would get hung up by repeated attempts to request more sales data from the server. When the server denied the request MM would continue to wait for the request to be approved.

After starting a new library [[https://github.com/ESOUIMods/LibGuildHistoryCache | LibGuildHistoryCache]] I observed that the cache mod would see some new sales. Usually there were only a few sales maybe 1 or 2 and occasionally less then 10. The cache mod would update showing that the guild history events were not duplicates but MM would not see them as new sales. 

One other calculation made was to try and get the first entry in the guild history and the last. This was used to attempt to determine whether or not to scan from the start of the guild history array, or the end. Whether or not you have 1, 100, or more then 1000 events the first event will always be the same. All guild history events are appended onto the end of the list.

For reasons like these MM no longer uses a background scan as it attempted to scan from a specific point in time and loop over the guild history events.

== Unintentional ZOS Bug

{{image-thumbnail:savedvarsapostrophe.jpg | savedvarsapostrophe}}

Unfortunately from time to time ZOS introduces or reintroduces a bug in the saved vars where the apostrophe is converted to HTML code. Which will mean your sales may or may not display properly. Which is a game bug and you are out of luck until or unless they fix it.

Since this can occur I highly recommend changing your user name to only contain letters as it will make it easier for you in the long run.

This also includes creative names that contain things like Æ or æ. As those are not individual letters.

== Three states of LibHistoire cache

### Unlinked

{{image:red_text_unlinked.jpg | red_text_unlinked}}

In the Unlinked state you can either wait for the server to grant the requests for offline data that LibHistoire requests, or you can manually request guild history for the time you were offline.

### Linking in progress

{{image:yellow_text_linking.jpg | yellow_text_linking}}

Once LibHistoire has what it feels it needs, then it will begin processing the guild history events and attempt to link to the last known event.

### Linked

{{image:green_text_linked.jpg | green_text_linked}}

Once LibHistoire has linked to its stored events you should see green text. This means that LibHistoire has finished processing the guild history.

{{note: You can still request additional history and ask LibHistoire to check the guild history for any missing sales events using the rescan button.}}

== Ten Day Scan

After upgrading to 3.x you will need to do a Ten Day Scan of all the guilds you are in. This ensures that LibHistoire has stored sales data for you to start working with. After doing a ten day scan for each guild you only need to request guild history for the time you have been offline.

{{note: Initially I had suggested requesting all the data at once. This seems to cause an issue for some users. Read this section carefully.}}

### Select A Guild

When you first log in there won’t be much as far as guild history loaded in memory.

{{image:show_more.jpg | show_more}}

In order to manually request sales data you have to choose a guild and select All, not purchases. Then press E about every 3 seconds so you are not kicked from the game by the server.

### Request only a few days at a time

{{image:one_day_of_data.jpg | one_day_of_data}}

You should be able to request two or three days of guild history at once. However, some users have seen issues requesting too much at one time. Each time you request a few days of data stop and, click the Rescan button.

### Rescan Button

{{image:ten_day_scan_refresh.jpg | ten_day_scan_refresh}}

The Rescan button is the equivalent of the old <code>/mm missing</code> and it will scan all the data loaded into memory so far. LibHistoire will skip any duplicate events as it scans guild history.

### When E is no longer showing

{{image:10_days_sales.jpg | show_more}}

Once you have scanned 10 days of sales then the option to press E will not be shown. The server will only allow you to request 10 days of data. Once you have done so click the [[#|Rescan Button]] to make sure LibHistoire processes all the events.

### LibHistoire GUI

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

As you perform a ten day scan the LibHistoire GUI will update. It might even finish processing a certain amount of events. Do not click the small chain link showing in this screen shot. That will link to the current events loaded which for your first initial use of LibHistoire you do not want that to happen. You should only click the [[#|Rescan Button]] if you see it to ensure all events are scanned.

{{note:Scanning 10 days of history every few days or every week is pointless and a drain on the server.}}

== Update Your Guild History Each Day

{{image:histy_gui.jpg | histy_gui}}

Regardless of how long you have been offline you need to update your guild history. To obtain older sales data for any time you have been offline you can wait for the server to send the data to LibHistoire. How quickly the server provides the data depends on many things. Because of that I do not wait. I manually scan the guild history from the guild history tab by [[#Select A Guild | pressing E for Show More]].

After I have enough guild history to cover the time I have been offline then I use the rescan button which asks LibHistoire to double check the sales loaded in memory are in the cache. Once LibHistoire has verified the sales data the text will turn green indicating that the [[#Linked | sales events are linked]].

== Unlinked Events Notification

With LibHistoire 1.2.0 there is a new notification when you log off.

{{image:log_off_notification.jpg | log_off_notification}}

You could have any amount of time that has not been linked with your Guild History Events. If you chose to log off that is fine but pay close attention to the notification. Any gap in information will still be there when you log back in and you will have to start over. Refer to [[#|Resolving Unlinked Events]] and [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] for more information.

{{note:If you open the Guild History have more then 10 days of missing events you will need to complete a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].}}

== Resolving Unlinked Events

{{image:unlinked_sales.jpg | unlinked_sales}}

The above screen shot indicates that there is 28 days and 19 hours worth of missing time from unlinked events. When this happens you can only fix it by doing a [[#|Ten Day Scan]].

To start request one day of data as shown in the screen shot for [[#|Request only a few days at a time]]. After you see one day of data then click the small chain link above sales as shown below.

{{image:chain_link.jpg | chain_link}}

After you click the chain link then you will be given a confirmation screen and you will want to click Confirm or press E to confirm the action.

{{image-caption:confirm_forcing.jpg | confirm_forcing | Since the server only stores 10 days of data, you will not be able to retrieve sales more then 10 days old.}}

Once the chain link is clicked LibHistoire will begin processing sales for the time you have loaded into memory. If you have done as suggested, it will process about 1 days worth of sales.

Then repeat the process mentioned in the [[#|Ten Day Scan]] by requesting a day or two of data and then click the small [[#|Rescan Button]]. Once the process is complete then remember to [[#|Update Your Guild History Each Day]] so this doesn't happen again.

{{note: This can happen in any guild however, this will occur in guilds with a high volume of sales per day more easily then in a guild with smaller amounts of sales.}}

{{note: Donations should be voluntary. People that struggle to make 25K gold a week, feel free to just say thanks. I'd rather receive a 50K donation from top sellers making millions a week.}}

== Guild Sales and Personal Sales

{{inline:175px | show_your_info.jpg | show_your_info}}{{inline:175px | show_all_info.jpg | show_all_info}}

First select what information you would like to see. <font class="tan">Show Personal Sales</font> will display info ONLY about You. <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font> will display data from all members of all of your guilds.

{{note: When the button says <font class="tan">Show Guild Sales</font>, that means you are currently viewing <font class="tan">YOUR</font> information and vice-versa. You can toggle back and forth between <font class="tan">Personal Sales</font> and <font class="tan">Guild Sales</font> while viewing any report.}}

== Item Report

{{image:item_report.jpg | item_report}}

If you have ever opened the Master Merchant window you have probably seen the list of your personal sales. This is an Item Report and if you click the [[#|People Icon]] you will change between the Buyer and the Seller.

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Buyer</font>: The purchaser of the item.
* <font class="tan">Guild</font>: The guild associated with the sale of the item.
* <font class="tan">Item Sold</font>: To the left of the Item Sold is the items icon. The number indicates how many of that item was sold.
* <font class="tan">Sale Time</font>: The approximate time the item was sold. The game stores all sales using epoch time so the UI just approximates the sale after the first hour.
* <font class="tan">Price</font>: The price the item sold for. You can view the individual price by clicking the Show Unit Price button.

{{inline:132px | show_unit_price.jpg | show_unit_price}} Toggle between the Unit Price and Total Sale.

== Seller's Report

### Top Buyers and Sellers

{{image:sellers_report_people.jpg | sellers_report_people}}

### Top Items

{{image:sellers_report_items.jpg | sellers_report_items}}

### Personal Sales - Seller's Report

{{image:sellers_report_personal.jpg | sellers_report_personal}}

{{note: You can also view a Seller's Report for your personal sales only the items will be <font class="tan">YOUR</font> top selling items.}}
{{note: Clicking the People Icon will cycle through Seller, Buyer, and Item Sold.}}

### What The Columns Mean

* <font class="tan">Rank</font>: The rank of the member or item for the guild listed. For example, if you are viewing a <font class="tan">seller's</font> report and your rank is <font class="tan">7</font>, it means you are the <font class="tan">7th</font> biggest <font class="tan">seller</font> in the guild for the time selected. If you are viewing an <font class="tan">item</font> report for and <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">1st</font> item in the list, then <font class="yellow">Dreugh Wax</font> is the <font class="tan">biggest seller</font> for the guild showing.
* <font class="tan">Sales/Purchases</font>: Total Sales or Purchases for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Tax</font>: Total Tax generated for that guild or member for the time selected.
* <font class="tan">Count</font>: The number on the left is the number of <font class="tan">transactions</font>, while the number on the right is the number of <font class="tan">items</font>. For example @TradingDude had <font class="yellow">10 Dreugh Wax</font> <font class="tan">transactions</font> and sold <font class="yellow">100 Dreugh wax</font> <font class="tan">total</font>.
* <font class="tan">Percent</font>: This shows what percent of total guild sales or purchases each member is responsible for.

== Date Ranges

{{image:time_frames.jpg | time_frames}}

There are several date ranges you can choose from. <font class="tan">This Week</font>, <font class="tan">Last Week</font> and <font class="tan">Prior Week</font> start from the ZOS trader flip for the current [[#|Sales Week]]. However, the last option is customizable under the Master Merchant settings under [[#|Calculation And Tip Options]].

== Refresh Button

{{image:refresh_button.jpg | refresh_button}}

The Refresh button tells LibHistoire to send all the data it has in its cache. The more data in the cache, the longer it will take to transmit.

The refresh button is only a fail safe mechanism in case a user performs the initial Ten Day scan incorrectly and the data is not sent to MM for some reason. It should not be clicked every so often or every once and a while. Clicking this does not refresh the Master Merchant window or cause the server to send any Guild History.

* <font class="tan">Sales History Size</font>: The days range to retain data.
* <font class="tan">Min Item Count</font>: The minimum count of sales for a specific item before the days range is considered. If you select 90 days to retain data, but you have seen only 1 sale and the only recorded sale is 120 days old it will not be trimmed.
* <font class="tan">Max Item Count</font>: The maximum count of sales for a specific item before the days range is considered. If you select 90 days to retain data, and you choose 1000, then the oldest sale once the threshold is reached will be trimmed. Meaning if you have 1001 sales for an item, 1 will be trimmed and 100 will remain.
* <font class="tan">Minimal Indexing</font>: Does not add search words for items. It only adds the player search word for displaying personal sales. Searching in the Master merchant window is still possible but will take extra time.

I will try to update the selector so that there are graphics to click on but for now it is just text.

The images below show a <font class="purple">Hat of a Mother's Sorrow</font> and the Legendary version does not have buttons on the right because there is no Mythic version. The Epic version has selectors on both the left and right to view the Superior or the Legendary version.

{{note: While the selectors do not seem to be dependant on the sales in your Master Merchant Data, there may be unknown factors that prevent the selector from showing. The code is extremely old and dates back to the introduction of the Champion Points system.}}

== Erroneous timestamp

When you see an erroneous timestamp, LibHistoire will handle this internally. It will not be processed until the timestamp is updated properly by the server.

{{image:1657months.jpg | 1657months}}
{{image:71582789minutes.jpg | 71582789minutes}}

LibHistoire will send the sale to MM after it checks that the erroneous timestamp is no longer present.

== What is being scanned

When LibHistoire is scanning the guild history it is obtaining the sales from all the guild history that you have loaded into memory.

### A few days of sales from 109 entries

{{image:shot_history.jpg | shot_history}}

LibHistoire simply scan entries from the guild history. With another mod installed called <font class="purple">Shissu's Guild Tools</font> a count of the amount of entries is showing. As shown there are 109 entries which only covers a few minutes of sales.

### 4 days of sales from 8031 entries

{{image:long_list.jpg | shot_history}}

However, as shown in the above screen shot there are 8031 entries which covers 4 days of sales. If you feel you are missing sales from 7 days ago then you will need more sales showing on the guild history tab.

== Sales Week

As of  August 11 2020 the kiosk flip is now [[ https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/540142/updates-to-guild-trader-swap-times/p1 | every Tuesday]]. All sales totals are calculated from the time indicated by ZOS.

You should not try to calculate your sales yourself. Each sale is saved with the exact time stamp the sale occurred. All sales even a few seconds prior to the kiosk flip would not show if you selected to see sales from This Week.

{{note:On the day of the kiosk flip sales for This Week will only reset after Zenimax transmits the new kiosk flip time. This can occur several hours after the kiosk flip.}}

= Slash commands

== Export Sales Report

{{image:mm_export_screen.jpg | mm_export_screen}}

Master Merchant can export a general summary of sales for use with spreadsheets. Full disclosure I am not a spreadsheet guru so I can not help with this feature. To use the export feature choose a guild to work with, then select the time and range like This Week or Last Week. Then use <code>/mm export #</code> to export the guild's information. As an example the screen shot shows a 2 for the 2nd guild in your list, therefore the syntax would be <code>/mm export 2</code>.

Once exported the data is saved in <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code> in your <code>SavedVariables</code> folder.

<font class="cyan">Without Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
    ["version"] = 1,
    ["YourGuildName"] = 
    {
        [1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Rank",
    },
</pre>

<font class="cyan">With Taxes:</font>
<pre>
["EXPORT"] = 
{
    ["version"] = 1,
    ["YourGuildName"] = 
    {
        [1] = "@GuildMember&Sales&Purchaces&Taxes&Rank",
    },
</pre>

{{note: Taxes is new as of 3.2.7 and you toggle the feature on in addon settings.}}

Since I have never used this feature with a spreadsheet I do not know how easy that is to use as Lua saves it. You may need to copy and paste it into another text file and use regular expressions to clean that up.

{{note: Some of my GMs have explained if this format changed it would break what they currently use so it will not be altered.}}

= Technical Information

== Backup LibGuildStore Data

{{image:lgs_data_backup.jpg | lgs_data_backup}}

To backup your LibGuildStore data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first. 

{{note: I am sorry I don't know where it is located on a Mac.}}

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 16 <code>GSxxData</code> files named <code>GS00Data.lua</code> to <code>GS15Data.lua</code> as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables. You will also want to keep a copy of <code>LibGuildStore.lua</code>, <code>LibHistoire.lua</code>, and <code>MasterMerchant.lua</code>.

== Backup Master Merchant Data

{{image:mm_data_backup.jpg | mm_data_backup}}

To backup your Master Merchant data you will need to navigate to the SavedVariables folder. Usually <code>C:\Users\Your User Name\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live</code>. The files can be easily found going to MyDocuments in windows first. 

{{note: I am sorry I don't know where it is located on a Mac.}}

Once you are in the SavedVariables folders, you will need to copy the 16 MMxxData files named MM00Data.lua to MM15Data.lua as shown in the screen shot. Copy these to a separate folder outside of SavedVariables and do not place them in a subfolder under SavedVariables.

== Uninstall Master Merchant 2.x

Currently there is some confusion about how to uninstall Master merchant 2.x and install 3.x. First you need to open minion. If you see both versions installed as shown below, uninstall both. The reason you uninstall both is because MM 3.x is a continuation of 2.x. It is the same mod with the same file names and the same folder names. Minion will not understand how to handle this.

If you manually install your mods, of if you want to know which folders belong to Master merchant, click the spoiler.

When using Minion to uninstall Master Merchant right click and choose Uninstall.

{{image:mm_remove_mod_caution.jpg | mm_remove_mod_caution}}

Do not check that box or it will remove your MM data files! Only click Delete!

As you see above, both versions of Master merchant are now uninstalled.

{{note: You have to close Minion because it will be confused about uninstalling both versions.}}

{{image:search_for_mm.jpg | search_for_mm}}

Open Minion again and click Find More and search for <code>Master Merchant 3.0</code> as shown above. Make sure the author's name is Sharlikran. Then click the Install button.

{{note: As noted on the description page you need to install LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider, LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire.}}

I won't be showing how to install all the required libraries. If you need examples images of the two new libraries LibGuildRoster, and LibHistoire click the spoiler.

After you install Master Merchant 3.0 verify it is the only Master Merchant showing in Minion.

== Locating LibExecutionQueue

LibExecutionQueue is included with Master Merchant as shown in the zip below.

LibExecutionQueue is sorted alphabetically by the base game.

If you have LibVotansAddonList installed then it will look close to the base game.
