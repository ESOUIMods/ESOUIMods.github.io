== Welcome to my space! But it's not MySpace, or is it?

This will have mods and guides for mods for Elder Scrolls online once I make more updates. For now all you get is a link to some downloads you can manually install. They do not require LibStub except Custom Titles because I feel it should not be removed at this time. However, there is a way to load it as a normal library and have it working while you are playing.

== Chapters, Zone DLC, Duengeon DLC

This is up to date as of __03/28/2020__

To play and be in the guild or do anything you don't need anything but the base game. The restriction will be the Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr chapters. If you do not have the chapters you can not access the Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr areas.

## Now let's talk Zone and Dungeon DLC.

[[ https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:DLC | DLC]]

Zone DLC would get you quests, content, story and skill lines. Dungeon DLC provides only Dungeon content which usually has a story and a quest.

== What I recomened for DLC

Guilds and Glory
- Dark Brotherhood - Zone DLC (Skill line, Quests, and Story)
- Imperial City (FREE) - Zone DLC (PvP and PvE gameplay)
- Orsinium - Zone DLC (Quests and Story)
- Thieves Guild - Zone DLC (Skill line, Quests, and Story)

Dragonhold - Zone DLC (Quests and Story)
Murkmire - Zone DLC (Quests and Story)
Clockwork City - Zone DLC (Quests and Story)

== What to buy

I don't know that they offer Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr chapters ALL separately. At the moment I only see Elsweyr for 29.99 US. So I recommend the Greymoor Digital Collector's Edition because it comes with all the chapters. I do not think it comes with the DLC.

Once you have that to have access to all content except dungeons you have two choices.

1) Get ESO Plus. It comes with 1500 Crowns (Currency for in game micro purchases) and access to all the Zone and Dungeon DLC. There is another benefit but in a moment. 2) Get the Greymoor CE and Guilds and Glory, Dragonhold, Dragonhold, and Clockwork City. This means you have all the content with no ESO Plus subscription. You can play any time off and on and never spend money on a subscription you are not using.

So you can obviously read all that but from a players perspective what it gives you that is noticeably useful is bank space and bag space. Your bank is doubled in size and all crafting materials go into a virtual bag that is limitless in size. Meaning you loot like crazy and as long as they are crafting mats you will never run out of bag space. Other then that you have to sell it to a vender or break it down into materials for crafting. The other thing that is different is your small house has double the capacity for decorations.

Then of course you have access to all the DLC content while ESO Plus is active.
