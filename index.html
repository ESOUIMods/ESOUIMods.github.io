<p>These days I maintain quite a few mods. I am probably most proud of Master Merchant 3.0 although I have much more I would like to optimize.</p>

<p>I have removed the LibStub requirements so they run without it. There is no need for LibStub because the functionality is now built into the game and some authors are simply to stubborn to remove it. Not having embedded libraries and removing LibStub really does help the mods run properly. I had one mod using Custom Compass Pins as an embedded library and when I updated it to the author's latest version it caused an error. Authors for ESO UI mods make the same kinds of mistakes that Nexus mod authors make in regards to optimization of the mods.</p>

<p>This is a good walkthrough of the game changes if you are a returning player. It is also a walkthrough of all the different aspects of the game. It is long but if you just bring it up on your phone and listen while you play you can think to yourself, "Yeah I know that, yeah I knew that, wait what was that?" and rewind it a bit for things you may not have known. It is a good refresher for returning players.</p>

<p>To play and be in the guild or do anything you don't need anything but the base game. If you do not own Elder Scrolls Online then the base game is <a  href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store/product/eso_highisle_edition" >High Isle</a> and includes the base game, new High Isle Chapter, and all previous Chapters Morrowind, Summerset, Elsweyr, Greymoor, and Blackwood.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p><a  href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Chapters" >Chapters</a></p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the UESP Wiki section for <a  href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Chapters#Bundles" >bundles</a>. For some reason I don't see any information from UESP about the Greymoor, Blackwood, and High Isle bundles at the time of this update. However, if you visit the ESO site for <a  href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/updates/chapter/highisle" >High Isle</a> since that is the latest chapter then review what you get with the different bundles. If you purchase the upgrade it will cost less but only provides you with the Blackwood chapter.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a returning player and you want more for you money then you should purchase either the base High Isle collection or the Collectors edition since they come with all the previous chapters.</p>

<p>Zone DLC would get you quests, content, story and skill lines. Dungeon DLC provides only Dungeon content which usually has a story and a quest.</p>

<h2 class="header2" id="WhatIrecommendedforDLC">1.7 - What I recommended for DLC</h2>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guilds and Glory</p>
<p class="list-1">-&nbsp; Dark Brotherhood - Zone DLC (Skill line, Quests, and Story)</p>
<p class="list-1">-&nbsp; Imperial City (FREE) - Zone DLC (PvP and PvE gameplay)</p>
<p class="list-1">-&nbsp; Orsinium - Zone DLC (Quests and Story)</p>

<p><a  href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store/product/eso_highisle_upgrade_ce" >High Isle™ Collector’s Edition Upgrade - Bethesda link</a></p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have all of the chapters then the Collector’s Edition Upgrade is the better value. I don't know that they offer Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr chapters separately anymore. If you have purchased all of the previous chapters as they were released with the exception of High Isle™ Upgrade, then buy the upgrade instead. <a  href="hhttps://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store/product/eso_highisle_upgrade" >High Isle™ Upgrade - Bethesda link</a></p>

<p>To have access to all content except dungeons you have two choices.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Get ESO Plus. It comes with 1650 Crowns each month you are subscribed (Currency for in game micro purchases) and access to all the Zone and Dungeon DLC. There are other benefits see the ESO Plus section below on this page. 2) Buy Crowns and purchace the DLC. Guilds and Glory, Dragonhold, Murkmire, Clockwork City, Markarth, Deadlands, and Firesong. This means you have all the extra Zones with no ESO Plus subscription. You can play any time off and on and never spend money on a subscription you are not using.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="header2" id="ESOPlus">1.9 - ESO Plus</h2>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p><a  href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/guides/esoplusguide" >ESO Plus - Bethesda link</a></p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you can obviously read all that but from a players perspective what it gives you that is noticeably useful is bank space and bag space. Your bank is doubled in size and all crafting materials go into a virtual bag that is limitless in size. Meaning you loot like crazy and as long as they are crafting mats you will never run out of bag space. Other then that you have to sell it to a vender or break it down into materials for crafting. The other thing that is different is your small house has double the capacity for decorations.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then of course you have access to all the DLC content while ESO Plus is active.</p>
