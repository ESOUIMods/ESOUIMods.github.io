<p>This will have mods and guides for mods for Elder Scrolls online once I make more updates. For now all you get is a link to some downloads you can manually install. They do not require LibStub except Custom Titles because I feel it should not be removed at this time. However, there is a way to load it as a normal library and have it working while you are playing.</p>
